wxWidgets 3.2.1 Release Notes
=============================

Welcome to the new stable release of wxWidgets, a free and open source
cross-platform C++ framework for writing advanced GUI applications using
native controls.

wxWidgets allows you to write native-looking GUI applications for all the major
desktop platforms and also helps with abstracting the differences in the non-GUI
aspects between them. It is free for the use in both open source and commercial
applications, comes with the full, easy to read and modify, source and extensive
documentation and a collection of more than a hundred examples. You can learn
more about wxWidgets at:

* https://www.wxwidgets.org/

Documentation is available online at:

* https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2.1/

wxWidgets sources and binaries for the selected platforms are available for
download from:

* https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

or, for a more more permanent but less convenient to use link, from

* https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.2.1/

Please see https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2.1/overview_install.html for full
installation instructions.



Changes since 3.2.0
-------------------

Coming soon after 3.2.0, this is mostly a bug fix release, with just one
noteworthy new feature: the addition of wxFileDialog::AddShortcut() function.
However it fixes some important regressions and other problems:

- Fix crash in applications calling g_log_set_writer_func() with recent glib.
- Several fixes to alpha channel handling in wxMSW bitmaps.
- Generate key and focus events for wxSearchCtrl in wxOSX.
- Fix creating wxRadioBox without any items in wxOSX.
- Fix regression with AUI floating pane positioning.
- Avoid new warnings given by gcc 12.
- Fix building with MSVS 2022 standard-conforming preprocessor.
- Work around MSVS 2022 optimizer bug that broke wxImage resizing.
- NetBSD build fixes.

Please see the full change log for more details:

This release is API and ABI-compatible with 3.2.0, so the existing
applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the fixes
above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.



Supported Platforms
-------------------

This version of wxWidgets supports the following primary platforms:

* Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and 11 (32/64 bits).
* Most Unix variants using the GTK+ toolkit (version 2.6 or newer)

Licence
-------

For licensing information, please see the files:

* docs/preamble.txt
* docs/licence.txt
* docs/licendoc.txt
* docs/gpl.txt
* docs/lgpl.txt
* docs/xserver.txt

Although this may seem complex, it is there to allow authors of proprietary,
commercial applications to use wxWidgets in addition to those writing GPL'ed
applications. In summary, the licence is LGPL plus a clause allowing
unrestricted distribution of application binaries. To answer a FAQ, you don't
have to distribute any source if you wish to write commercial applications using
wxWidgets.

However, if you distribute wxGTK, wxQt or wxMotif (with Lesstif) version of your
application, don't forget that it is linked against GTK+, Qt or Lesstif, which
are covered by LGPL *without* exception notice and so is bound by its
requirements.

If you use TIFF image handler, please see src/tiff/COPYRIGHT for libtiff licence
details.

If you use JPEG image handler, documentation for your program should contain
following sentence: "This software is based in part on the work of the
Independent JPEG Group". See src/jpeg/README for details.

If you use wxRegEx class, please see 3rdparty/pcre/LICENCE for PCRE licence
details.

If you use wxXML classes or XRC, see src/expat/COPYING for licence details.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

The wxWidgets bug tracker can be found here:

* https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/issues/

Please use the search function find any possibly relevant bugs before reporting
new ones. Also please notice that often trying to correct the bug yourself is
the quickest way to fix it. Even if you fail to do it, you may discover
valuable information allowing us to fix it while doing it. We also give much
higher priority to bug reports with patches fixing the problems so this ensures
that your report will be addressed sooner.
