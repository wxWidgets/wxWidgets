wxWidgets 3.2.8 Release Notes
=============================

Welcome to the new stable release of wxWidgets, a free and open source
cross-platform C++ framework for writing advanced GUI applications using
native controls.

wxWidgets allows you to write native-looking GUI applications for all the major
desktop platforms and also helps with abstracting the differences in the non-GUI
aspects between them. It is free for the use in both open source and commercial
applications, comes with the full, easy to read and modify, source and extensive
documentation and a collection of more than a hundred examples. You can learn
more about wxWidgets at:

* https://www.wxwidgets.org/

Documentation is available online at:

* https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2.8/

wxWidgets sources and binaries for the selected platforms are available for
download from:

* https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

or, for a more more permanent but less convenient to use link, from

* https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.2.8/

Please see https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2.8/overview_install.html for full
installation instructions.



Changes since 3.2.7
-------------------

This is mostly a bug fix release correcting several problems found in the
previous 3.2.7 release:

- Fix crash in wxPropertyGrid with wxGTK3 after recent change (#25286).
- Fix padding of wxMenu in high DPI under Windows 11 (#25117).
- Fix key codes in WXK_NUMPADx events in wxGTK (#25263).
- Fix ABI breakage for versioned symbols in 3.2.7 (#25327).
- Fix third party libraries build with Xcode 16.3.
- Fix using OpenGL and WebView when using CMake install (#25266).

But it still contains a couple of enhancements, including:

- Add wxVector(std::initializer_list<U> list) ctor (#25290).
- Add mouse scrolling support to generic wxSpinCtrl (#24935).
- Add @USER@ macro to HTML and RichText printers (#25318).

Other changes include:

- Call OnExceptionInMainLoop() in wxGTK if idle event handler throws (#25312).
- Compute wxStaticText best size ourselves if GTK does it wrongly (#24781).
- Fix page count display in wxHtmlPrintout when there is only one page (#25320).
- Miscellaneous CMake build improvements (#25324).
- Fix new warnings with gcc 15 (#25338).
- Update Brazilian Portuguese translations.

Please see the full change log for more details:

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x releases, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

This version of wxWidgets supports the following primary platforms:

* Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and 11 (32/64 bits).

Licence
-------

For licensing information, please see the files:

* docs/preamble.txt
* docs/licence.txt
* docs/licendoc.txt
* docs/gpl.txt
* docs/lgpl.txt
* docs/xserver.txt

Although this may seem complex, it is there to allow authors of proprietary,
commercial applications to use wxWidgets in addition to those writing GPL'ed
applications. In summary, the licence is LGPL plus a clause allowing
unrestricted distribution of application binaries. To answer a FAQ, you don't
have to distribute any source if you wish to write commercial applications using
wxWidgets.

However, if you distribute wxGTK, wxQt or wxMotif (with Lesstif) version of your
application, don't forget that it is linked against GTK+, Qt or Lesstif, which
are covered by LGPL *without* exception notice and so is bound by its
requirements.

If you use TIFF image handler, please see src/tiff/COPYRIGHT for libtiff licence
details.

If you use JPEG image handler, documentation for your program should contain
following sentence: "This software is based in part on the work of the
Independent JPEG Group". See src/jpeg/README for details.

If you use wxRegEx class, please see 3rdparty/pcre/LICENCE for PCRE licence
details.

If you use wxXML classes or XRC, see src/expat/COPYING for licence details.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

The wxWidgets bug tracker can be found here:

* https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/issues/

Please use the search function find any possibly relevant bugs before reporting
new ones. Also please notice that often trying to correct the bug yourself is
the quickest way to fix it. Even if you fail to do it, you may discover
valuable information allowing us to fix it while doing it. We also give much
higher priority to bug reports with patches fixing the problems so this ensures
that your report will be addressed sooner.
