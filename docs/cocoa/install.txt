On Mac OS X, wxWidgets can be compiled using Apple's Carbon or Cocoa libraries.

To compile using Carbon or Cocoa, see the instructions in docs/mac/install.txt

wxCocoa is still a work in progress.

To compile it, you will need Apple's Developer Tools.  However, please
note that any work to make it suitable for GNUstep (which will require
a GCC release with Objective-C++) will be much appreciated.

Some users also report success with Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE and I've even
on occasion used the command-line MW compilers (see docs/metrowerks) with
configure instead of GCC and Apple's LD.

Like most UNIX ports, the standard configure/make method works.  You should
be able to build the library as static or shared.  I usually build static.

On my system I have the following:

Checked out CVS source is in:
/Users/dfe/devel/wxHEADcommit/wxWidgets
Debug build directory is:
/Users/dfe/devel/wxHEADcommit/BUILD_COCOAd

From the debug build directory:
$ ../wxWidgets/configure --with-cocoa --enable-debug --disable-shared
$ make
$ cd samples/minimal
$ make
$ ./minimal.app/Contents/MacOS/minimal

Like wxMac applications, wxCocoa applications are "bundled".  For development
purposes all this means is that an executable named "foo" needs to be
inside a "foo.app/Contents/MacOS" directory.  For deployment you will need
an appropriate Info.plist and PkgInfo inside the foo.app/Contents directory.

wxCocoa (and Cocoa in general) has no need for Mac OS resources.  It
certainly has no need for resource forks as no Mach-O applications should
_ever_ have resource forks (note: Bakefile violates this right now).
Please see the wxWiki and/or discuss this with wx-users before shipping
any wxCocoa apps if you are new to the OS X platform.
