\section{\class{wxLongLong}}\label{wxlonglong}

This class represents a signed 64 bit long number. It is implemented using the
native 64 bit type where available (machines with 64 bit longs or compilers
which have (an analog of) {\it long long} type) and uses the emulation code in
the other cases which ensures that it is the most efficient solution for
working with 64 bit integers independently of the architecture.

wxLongLong defines all usual arithmetic operations such as addition,
substraction, bitwise shifts and logical operations as well as multiplication
and division (not yet for the machines without native {\it long long}). It
also has operators for implicit construction from and conversion to the native 
{\it long long} type if it exists and {\it long}.

You would usually use this type in exactly the same manner as any other
(built-in) arithmetic type. Note that wxLongLong is a signed type.

If a native (i.e. supported directly by the compiler) 64 bit integer type was
found a typedef {\it wxLongLong\_t} will be defined to correspond it.

\membersection{wxLongLong::wxLongLong}\label{wxlonglongwxlonglongdef}

\func{}{wxLongLong}{\void}

Default constructor initializes the object to 0.

\membersection{wxLongLong::wxLongLong}\label{wxlonglongwxlonglongll}

\func{}{wxLongLong}{\param{wxLongLong\_t }{ll}}

Constructor from native long long (only for compilers supporting it).

\membersection{wxLongLong::wxLongLong}\label{wxlonglongwxlonglong}

\func{}{wxLongLong}{\param{long }{hi}, \param{unsigned long }{lo}}

Constructor from 2 longs: the high and low part are combined into one
wxLongLong.

\membersection{wxLongLong::operator=}\label{wxlonglongoperatorassign}

\func{wxLongLong\& operator}{operator=}{\param{wxLongLong\_t }{ll}}

Assignment operator from native long long (only for compilers supporting it).

\membersection{wxLongLong::Abs}\label{wxlonglongabs}

\constfunc{wxLongLong}{Abs}{\void}

\func{wxLongLong\&}{Abs}{\void}

Returns an absolute value of wxLongLong - either making a copy (const version)
or modifying it in place (the second one).

\membersection{wxLongLong::Assign}\label{wxlonglongassign}

\func{wxLongLong\&}{Assign}{\param{double }{d}}

This allows to convert a double value to wxLongLong type. Such conversion is
not always possible in which case the result will be silently truncated in a
platform-dependent way.

\membersection{wxLongLong::GetHi}\label{wxlonglonggethi}

\constfunc{long}{GetHi}{\void}

Returnes the high 32 bits of 64 bit integer.

\membersection{wxLongLong::GetLo}\label{wxlonglonggetlo}

\constfunc{unsigned long}{GetLo}{\void}

Returnes the low 32 bits of 64 bit integer.

\membersection{wxLongLong::GetValue}\label{wxlonglonggetvalue}

\constfunc{wxLongLong\_t}{GetValue}{\void}

Convert to native long long (only for compilers supporting it)

\membersection{wxLongLong::ToLong}\label{wxlonglongtolong}

\constfunc{long}{ToLong}{\void}

Truncate wxLongLong to long. If the conversion loses data (i.e. the wxLongLong
value is outside the range of built-in long type), an assert will be triggered
in debug mode.

\membersection{wxLongLong::operator$+$}\label{wxlonglongoperatorplus}

\constfunc{wxLongLong}{operator$+$}{\param{const wxLongLong\& }{ll}}

Adds 2 wxLongLongs together and returns the result.

\membersection{wxLongLong::operator$+=$}\label{wxlonglongoperatorplusassign}

\func{wxLongLong\&}{operator+}{\param{const wxLongLong\& }{ll}}

Add another wxLongLong to this one.

\membersection{wxLongLong::operator$++$}\label{wxlonglongoperatorinc}

\func{wxLongLong\&}{operator$++$}{\void}

\func{wxLongLong\&}{operator$++$}{\param{int}{}}

Pre/post increment operator.

\membersection{wxLongLong::operator$-$}\label{wxlonglongoperatorunaryminus}

\constfunc{wxLongLong}{operator$-$}{\void}

Returns the value of this wxLongLong with opposite sign.

\membersection{wxLongLong::operator$-$}\label{wxlonglongoperatorminus}

\constfunc{wxLongLong}{operator$-$}{\param{const wxLongLong\& }{ll}}

Substracts 2 wxLongLongs and returns the result.

\membersection{wxLongLong::operator$-=$}\label{wxlonglongoperatorminusassign}

\func{wxLongLong\&}{operator-}{\param{const wxLongLong\& }{ll}}

Substracts another wxLongLong from this one.

\membersection{wxLongLong::operator$--$}\label{wxlonglongoperatordec}

\func{wxLongLong\&}{operator$--$}{\void}

\func{wxLongLong\&}{operator$--$}{\param{int}{}}

Pre/post decrement operator.

% TODO document all other arithmetics operations: shitfs, multiplication,
% division, bitwise, comparison
