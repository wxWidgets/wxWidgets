\section{\class{wxSplitterRenderParams}}\label{wxsplitterrenderparams}

This is just a simple {\tt struct} used as a return value of 
\helpref{wxRendererNative::GetSplitterParams}{wxrenderernativegetsplitterparams}.

It doesn't have any methods and all of its fields are constant and so can be
only examined but not modified.
