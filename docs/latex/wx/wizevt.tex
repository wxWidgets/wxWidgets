\section{\class{wxWizardEvent}}\label{wxwizardevent}

wxWizardEvent class represents an event generated by the
\helpref{wizard}{wxwizard}: this event is first sent to the page itself and,
if not processed there, goes up the window hierarchy as usual.

\wxheading{Derived from}

\helpref{wxNotifyEvent}{wxnotifyevent}\\
\helpref{wxCommandEvent}{wxcommandevent}\\
\helpref{wxEvent}{wxevent}\\

\wxheading{Event table macros}

To process input from a wizard dialog, use these event handler macros to
direct input to member functions that take a wxWizardEvent argument.

\twocolwidtha{7cm}
\begin{twocollist}\itemsep=2pt
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_WIZARD\_PAGE\_CHANGED(id, func)}}{The page has been just
changed (this event can not be vetoed).}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_WIZARD\_PAGE\_CHANGING(id, func)}}{The page is being
changed (this event can be vetoed).}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_WIZARD\_CANCEL(id, func)}}{The user attempted to cancel
the wizard (this event may also be vetoed).}
\end{twocollist}%

\func{}{wxWizardEvent}{\param{wxEventType }{type = wxEVT\_NULL}, \param{int }{id = -1}, \param{bool }{direction = TRUE}}

Constructor. It is not normally used by the user code as the objects of this
type are constructed by wxWizard.

\membersection{wxWizardEvent::GetDirection}\label{wxwizardeventgetdirection}

\constfunc{bool}{GetDirection}{\void}

Return the direction in which the page is changing: for {\tt
EVT\_WIZARD\_PAGE\_CHANGING}, return {\tt TRUE} if we're going forward or
FALSE otherwise and for {\tt EVT\_WIZARD\_PAGE\_CHANGED} return {\tt TRUE} if
we came from the previous page and {\tt FALSE} if we returned from the next
one.
