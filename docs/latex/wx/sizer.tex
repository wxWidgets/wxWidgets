\section{\class{wxSizer}}\label{wxsizer}

wxSizer is the abstract base class used for layouting subwindows in a window. You
cannot use wxSizer directly; instead, you'll have to use \helpref{wxBoxSizer}{wxboxsizer}
or \helpref{wxStaticBoxSizer}{wxstaticboxsizer}.

The layouting algorithm used by sizers in wxWindows closely related to layouting
in other GUI toolkits, such as Java's AWT, the GTK toolkit or the Qt toolkit. It is
based upon the idea of the individual subwindows reporting their minimal required
size and their ability to get stretched if the size of the parent window has changed.
This will most often mean, that the programmer does not set the original size of
the dialog in the beginning, rather the top-most sizer will get queried and it will 
then query its children. Its children can be normal windows or other sizers, so that
a hierachy of sizer can be constructed. Note that sizer are not derived from wxWindows
and thus do not interfere with tab ordering and require very little resources compared
to a real window on screen.

What makes sizers so well fitted for use in wxWindows, is the fact that every control
reports its own minimal size and the algorithm can handle differences in font sizes
or different window (dialog item) sizes on different platforms without problems. If e.g.
the standard font as well as the overall design of Motif widgets requires more space than
on Windows, the intial dialog size will automatically be bigger on Motif than on Windows.

\membersection{wxSizer::wxSizer}\label{wxsizerwxsizer}

\func{}{wxSizer}{\void}

The constructor. Note that wxSizer is an abstract base class and may not
be instantiated.

\membersection{wxSizer::\destruct{wxSizer}}\label{wxsizerdtor}

\func{}{\destruct{wxSizer}}{\void}

The destructor.

\membersection{wxSizer::Add}\label{wxsizeradd}

\func{void}{Add}{\param{wxWindow* }{window}, \param{int }{option = 0}, \param{int }{flag = 0}, \param{int }{border = 0}}

\func{void}{Add}{\param{wxSizer* }{sizer}, \param{int }{option = 0}, \param{int }{flag = 0}, \param{int }{border = 0}}

\func{void}{Add}{\param{int }{width}, \param{int }{height}, \param{int }{option = 0}, \param{int }{flag = 0}, \param{int }{border = 0}}

Adds the {\it window} to the sizer. As wxSizer itself is an abstract class, the parameters
have no meaning in the wxSizer class itself, but as there currently is only one class
deriving directly from wxSizer and this class does not override these methods, the meaning
of the paramters is described here:

\membersection{wxSizer::Prepend}\label{wxsizerprepend}

\func{void}{Prepend}{\param{wxWindow* }{window}, \param{int }{option = 0}, \param{int }{flag = 0}, \param{int }{border = 0}}

\func{void}{Prepend}{\param{wxSizer* }{sizer}, \param{int }{option = 0}, \param{int }{flag = 0}, \param{int }{border = 0}}

\func{void}{Prepend}{\param{int }{width}, \param{int }{height}, \param{int }{option = 0}, \param{int }{flag = 0}, \param{int }{border = 0}}

Same as \helpref{wxSizer::Add}{wxsizeradd}, but prepends the items to the beginning of the
list of items (windows, subsizers or spaces) own by this sizer.

\membersection{wxSizer::Remove}\label{wxsizerremove}

\func{bool}{Remove}{\param{wxWindow* }{window}}

\func{bool}{Remove}{\param{wxSizer* }{sizer}}

\func{bool}{Remove}{\param{int }{nth}}

Removes a child from the sizer. {\it window} is the window to be removed, {\it sizer} the
equivalent sizer and {\it nth} is the position of the child in the sizer, typically 0 for
the first item. This method does not cause any layouting or resizing to take place and does
not delete the window itself. Call \helpref{wxSizer::Layout}{wxsizerlayout} for updating
the layout "on screen" after removing a child fom the sizer.

Returns TRUE if the child item was found and removed, FALSE otherwise.

\membersection{wxSizer::SetDimension}\label{wxsizersetdimension}

\func{void}{SetDimension}{\param{int }{x}, \param{int }{y}, \param{int }{width}, \param{int }{height}}

Call this to force the sizer to take the given dimension and thus force the items owned
by the sizer to resize themselves according to the rules defined by the paramater in the
\helpref{wxSizer::Add}{wxsizeradd} and \helpref{wxSizer::Prepend}{wxsizerprepend} methods.

\membersection{wxSizer::GetSize}\label{wxsizergetsize}

\func{wxSize}{GetSize}{\void}

Returns the current size of the sizer.

\membersection{wxSizer::GetPosition}\label{wxsizergetposition}

\func{wxPoint}{GetPosition}{\void}

Returns the current position of the sizer.

\membersection{wxSizer::GetMinSize}\label{wxsizergetminsize}

\func{wxSize}{GetMinSize}{\void}

Returns the minimal size of the sizer.

\membersection{wxSizer::RecalcSizes}\label{wxsizerrecalcsizes}

\func{void}{RecalcSizes}{\void}

This method is abstract and has to be overwritten by any derived class.
Here, the sizer will do the actual calculation of its children's positions
and sizes.

\membersection{wxSizer::CalcMin}\label{wxsizercalcmin}

\func{wxSize}{CalcMin}{\void}

This method is abstract and has to be overwritten by any derived class.
Here, the sizer will do the actual calculation of its children minimal sizes.

\membersection{wxSizer::Layout}\label{wxsizerlayout}

\func{void}{Layout}{\void}

Call this to force laying out the children anew, e.g. after having added a child
to or removed a child (window, other sizer or space) from the sizer while keeping
the current dimension.

\membersection{wxSizer::Fit}\label{wxsizerfit}

\func{void}{Fit}{\param{wxWindow* }{window}}

Tell the sizer to resize the {\it window} to match the sizer's minimal size. This
is commonly done in the constructor of the window itself, see sample in the description
of \helpref{wxBoxSizer}{wxboxsizer}.

\membersection{wxSizer::SetSizeHints}\label{wxsizersetsizehints}

\func{void}{SetSizeHints}{\param{wxWindow* }{window}}

Tell the sizer to set the minimal size of the {\it window} to match the sizer's minimal size. 
This is commonly done in the constructor of the window itself, see sample in the description
of \helpref{wxBoxSizer}{wxboxsizer} if the window is resizable (as many dialogs under Unix and
frames on probably all platforms).
