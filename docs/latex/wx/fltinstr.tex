\func{}{wxFilterInputStream}{\param{wxInputStream\&}{ stream}}

Initializes a "filter" stream. A filter stream has the capability of a normal
stream but it can be placed on the top of another stream. So, for example, it
can uncompress, uncrypt the datas which are read from another stream and pass it
to the requester.
