\section{wxWindows samples}\label{samples}

Probably the best way to learn wxWindows is by reading the source of some 50+
samples provided with it. Many aspects of wxWindows programming can be learnt
from them, but sometimes it is not simple to just choose the right sample to
look at. This overview aims at describing what each sample does/demonstrates to
make it easier to find the relevant one if a simple grep through all sources
didn't help. They also provide some notes about using the samples and what
features of wxWindows are they supposed to test.

\subsection{DnD sample}{samplednd}

This sample shows both clipboard and drag and drop in action. It is quite non
trivial and may be safely used as a basis for implementing the clipboard and
drag and drop operations in a real-life program.

When you run the sample, its screen is split in several parts. On the top,
there are two listboxes which show the standard derivations of 
\helpref{wxDropTarget}{wxdroptarget}: 
\helpref{wxTextDropTarget}{wxtextdroptarget} and 
\helpref{wxFileDropTarget}{wxfiledroptarget}.

The middle of the sample window is taken by the log window which shows what is
going on (of course, this only works in debug builds) and may be helpful to see
the sequence of steps of data transfer.

Finally, the last part is used for two things: you can drag text from it to
either one of the listboxes (only one will accept it) or another application
and, also, bitmap pasted from clipboard will be shown there.

So far, everything we mentioned was implemented with minimal amount of code
using standard wxWindows classes. The more advanced features are demonstrated
if you create a shape frame from the main frame menu. A shape is a geometric
object which has a position, size and color. It models some
application-specific data in this sample. A shape object supports its own
private \helpref{wxDataFormat}{wxdataformat} which means that you may cut and
paste it or drag and drop (between one and the same or different shapes) from
one sample instance to another (or the same). However, chances are that no
other program supports this format and so shapes can also be rendered as
bitmaps which allows them to be pasted/dropped in many other applications.

Take a look at DnDShapeDataObject class to see how you may use 
\helpref{wxDataObject}{wxdataobject} to achieve this.
