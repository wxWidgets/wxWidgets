\membersection{wxHTTP::GetInputStream}\label{wxprotogetinput}

\func{wxInputStream *}{GetInputStream}{\param{const wxString\&}{ path}}

Creates a new input stream on the the specified path. You can use all but seek
functionnality of wxStream. Seek isn't available on all stream. For example,
http or ftp streams doesn't deal with it. Other functions like StreamSize and
Tell aren't available for the moment for this sort of stream.
You will be notified when the EOF is reached by an error.

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns the initialized stream. You will have to delete it yourself once you
don't use it anymore. The destructor closes the network connection.
The next time you will try to get a file the network connection will have
to be reestablished: but you don't have to take care of this wxHTTP reestablishes it automatically.

\func{void}{SetHeader}{\param{const wxString\&}{ header}, \param{const wxString\&}{ h_data}}

name is specified by \it{header} and the content by \it{h_data}.
