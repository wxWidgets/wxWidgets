\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_OUTPUT}}{The socket is ready to be written to.}
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_CONNECTION}}{Incoming connection (server), or connection establishment (client).}
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_LOST}}{The connection has been closed.}
\end{twocollist}

A brief note on how to use these events:

The {\bf wxSOCKET\_INPUT} event will be issued whenever there is data
available for reading. This will be the case if the input queue was
empty and new data arrives, or if the application has read some data
yet there is still more data available. This means that the application
does not need to read all available data in response to a
{\bf wxSOCKET\_INPUT} event, as more events will be produced as
necessary.

The {\bf wxSOCKET\_OUTPUT} event is issued when a socket is first
connected with Connect or accepted with Accept. After that, new
events will be generated only after an output operation fails
with {\bf wxSOCKET\_WOULDBLOCK} and buffer space becomes available
again. This means that the application should assume that it
can write data to the socket until an {\bf wxSOCKET\_WOULDBLOCK}
error occurs; after this, whenever the socket becomes writable
again the application will be notified with another
{\bf wxSOCKET\_OUTPUT} event.

The {\bf wxSOCKET\_CONNECTION} event is issued when a delayed connection
request completes succesfully (client) or when a new connection arrives
at the incoming queue (server).

The {\bf wxSOCKET\_LOST} event is issued when a close indication is
received for the socket. This means that the connection broke down or
that it was closed by the peer. Also, this event will be issued if
a delayed connection request fails.

\membersection{wxSocketBase::SetFlags}\label{wxsocketbasesetflags}

\func{void}{SetFlags}{\param{wxSocketBase::wxSockFlags}{ flags}}

\twocolwidtha{7cm}
\begin{twocollist}\itemsep=0pt
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_NONE}}{Normal functionality.}
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_NOWAIT}}{Read/write as much data as possible and return immediately.}
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_WAITALL}}{Wait for all required data to be read/written unless an error occurs.}
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_BLOCK}}{Block the GUI (do not wxYield) while reading/writing data.}
\end{twocollist}

A brief overview on how to use these flags follows.

If no flag is specified (this is the same as {\bf wxSOCKET\_NONE}),
IO calls will return after some data has been read or written, even
when the transfer might not be complete. This is the same as issuing
exactly one blocking low-level call to recv() or send(). Note that
blocking here refers to when the function returns, not to whether
the GUI blocks during this time.

If {\bf wxSOCKET\_NOWAIT} is specified, IO calls will return immediately.
Read operations will retrieve only available data. Write operations will
write as much data as possible, depending on how much space is available
in the output buffer. This is the same as issuing exactly one nonblocking
low-level call to recv() or send(). Note that nonblocking here refers to
when the function returns, not to whether the GUI blocks during this time.

If {\bf wxSOCKET\_WAITALL} is specified, IO calls won't return until ALL
the data has been read or written (or until an error occurs), blocking if
necessary, and issuing several low level calls if necessary. This is the
same as having a loop which makes as many blocking low-level calls to
recv() or send() as needed so as to transfer all the data. Note that
"blocking" here refers to when the function returns, not to whether
the GUI blocks during this time.

The {\bf wxSOCKET\_BLOCK} flag controls whether the GUI blocks during
IO operations. If this flag is not used, then the application must take
extra care to avoid unwanted reentrance. 

So:

{\bf wxSOCKET\_NONE} will try to read at least SOME data, no matter how much.

{\bf wxSOCKET\_NOWAIT} will always return immediately, even if it cannot
read or write ANY data.

{\bf wxSOCKET\_WAITALL} will only return when it has read or written ALL
the data.

{\bf wxSOCKET\_BLOCK} has nothing to do with the previous flags and
it controls whether the GUI blocks.

%
% SetNotify
%
\membersection{wxSocketBase::SetNotify}\label{wxsocketbasesetnotify}

\func{void}{SetNotify}{\param{wxSocketEventFlags}{ flags}}

SetNotify specifies which socket events are to be sent to the event handler.
The {\it flags} parameter is a combination of flags ORed toghether. The
following flags can be used:

\twocolwidtha{7cm}
\begin{twocollist}\itemsep=0pt
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_INPUT\_FLAG}}{to receive wxSOCKET\_INPUT}
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_OUTPUT\_FLAG}}{to receive wxSOCKET\_OUTPUT}
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_CONNECTION\_FLAG}}{to receive wxSOCKET\_CONNECTION}
\twocolitem{{\bf wxSOCKET\_LOST\_FLAG}}{to receive wxSOCKET\_LOST}
\end{twocollist}

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
  sock.SetNotify(wxSOCKET_INPUT_FLAG | wxSOCKET_LOST_FLAG);
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the user will be notified about incoming socket data and
whenever the connection is closed.

For more information on socket events see \helpref{wxSocket events}{wxsocketbase}.

%
% SetTimeout
%
\membersection{wxSocketBase::SetTimeout}\label{wxsocketbasesettimeout}

\func{void}{SetTimeout}{\param{int }{seconds}}

This function sets the default socket timeout in seconds. This
timeout applies to IO calls, and also to Wait() functions if you
don't specify a wait interval. If you never use SetTimeout(), the
default timeout will be 10 minutes.

%
% Notify
%
\membersection{wxSocketBase::Notify}\label{wxsocketbasenotify}

\func{void}{Notify}{\param{bool}{ notify}}

Notify will enable (notify is TRUE) or disable (notify is FALSE) the propagation
of socket events.

% 
% Ok
%

\membersection{wxSocketBase::Ok}\label{wxsocketbaseok}

\constfunc{bool}{Ok}{\void}

Returns TRUE if the socket is initialized and ready and FALSE in other
cases.

\membersection{wxSocketBase::Error}\label{wxsocketbaseerror}

\constfunc{bool}{Error}{\void}

Returns TRUE if an error occured in the last IO operation.

The following operations update the Error() status:
Read, Write, ReadMsg, WriteMsg, Peek, Unread, Discard.

\membersection{wxSocketBase::IsConnected}\label{wxsocketbaseconnected}

\constfunc{bool}{IsConnected}{\void}

Returns TRUE if the socket is connected.

\membersection{wxSocketBase::IsData}\label{wxsocketbaseisdata}

\constfunc{bool}{IsData}{\void}

Returns TRUE if there is data available to be read. 

\membersection{wxSocketBase::IsDisconnected}\label{wxsocketbasedisconnected}

\constfunc{bool}{IsDisconnected}{\void}

Returns TRUE if the socket is disconnected.

\membersection{wxSocketBase::IsNoWait}\label{wxsocketbasenowait}

\constfunc{bool}{IsNoWait}{\void}

Returns TRUE if the socket mustn't wait.

\membersection{wxSocketBase::LastCount}\label{wxsocketbaselastcount}

\constfunc{wxUint32}{LastCount}{\void}

Returns the number of bytes read or written by the last IO call.

The following operations update the LastCount() value:
Read, Write, ReadMsg, WriteMsg, Peek, Unread, Discard.

\membersection{wxSocketBase::LastError}\label{wxsocketbaselasterror}

\constfunc{wxSocketError}{LastError}{\void}

Returns the last wxSocket error. See \helpref{wxSocket errors}{wxsocketbase}.

Please note that this function merely returns the last error code,
but it should not be used to determine if an error has occured (this
is because successful operations do not change the LastError value).
Use Error, instead of LastError, to determine if the last IO call
failed. If Error returns TRUE, use LastError to discover the
cause of the error.

%
% Peek
%
\membersection{wxSocketBase::Peek}\label{wxsocketbasepeek}

\func{wxSocketBase\&}{Peek}{\param{char *}{ buffer}, \param{wxUint32}{ nbytes}}

This function peeks a buffer of {\it nbytes} bytes from the socket.
Peeking a buffer doesn't delete it from the socket input queue.

Use LastCount to verify the number of bytes actually peeked.

Use Error to determine if the operation succeeded.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{buffer}{Buffer where to put peeked data.}

\docparam{nbytes}{Number of bytes.}

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns a reference to the current object.

\wxheading{Remark/Warning}

The exact behaviour of wxSocketBase::Peek() depends on the combination
of flags being used. For a detailed explanation, see \helpref{wxSocketBase::SetFlags}{wxsocketbasesetflags}

\membersection{wxSocketBase::Write}\label{wxsocketbasewrite}

\func{wxSocketBase\&}{Write}{\param{const char *}{ buffer}, \param{wxUint32}{ nbytes}}

This function writes a buffer of {\it nbytes} bytes to the socket.

Use LastCount to verify the number of bytes actually written.

Use Error to determine if the operation succeeded.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{buffer}{Buffer with the data to be sent.}

\docparam{nbytes}{Number of bytes.}

% WriteMsg
%
\membersection{wxSocketBase::WriteMsg}\label{wxsocketbasewritemsg}

\func{wxSocketBase\&}{WriteMsg}{\param{const char *}{ buffer}, \param{wxUint32}{ nbytes}}

This function writes a buffer of {\it nbytes} bytes from the socket, but it
writes a short header before so that ReadMsg knows how much data should it
actually read. So, a buffer sent with WriteMsg {\bf must} be read with
ReadMsg. This function always waits for the entire buffer to be sent,
unless an error occurs.

Use LastCount to verify the number of bytes actually written.

Use Error to determine if the operation succeeded.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{buffer}{Buffer with the data to be sent.}

\docparam{nbytes}{Number of bytes.}

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns a reference to the current object.

\wxheading{Remark/Warning}

wxSocketBase::WriteMsg() will behave as if the {\bf wxSOCKET\_WAITALL} flag
was always set and it will always ignore the {\bf wxSOCKET\_NOWAIT} flag.
The exact behaviour of WriteMsg depends on the {\bf wxSOCKET\_BLOCK} flag.

% ReadMsg
%
\membersection{wxSocketBase::ReadMsg}\label{wxsocketbasereadmsg}

\func{wxSocketBase\&}{ReadMsg}{\param{char *}{ buffer}, \param{wxUint32}{ nbytes}}

This function reads a buffer sent by WriteMsg on a socket. If the buffer passed
to the function isn't big enough, the remaining bytes will be discarded. This
function always waits for the buffer to be entirely filled, unless an error occurs.

Use LastCount to verify the number of bytes actually read.

Use Error to determine if the operation succeeded.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{buffer}{Buffer where to put read data.}

\docparam{nbytes}{Number of bytes allocated for the buffer.}

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns a reference to the current object.

\wxheading{Remark/Warning}

wxSocketBase::ReadMsg() will behave as if the {\bf wxSOCKET\_WAITALL} flag
was always set and it will always ignore the {\bf wxSOCKET\_NOWAIT} flag.

%
% Unread
%
\membersection{wxSocketBase::Unread}\label{wxsocketbaseunread}

\func{wxSocketBase\&}{Unread}{\param{const char *}{ buffer}, \param{wxUint32}{ nbytes}}

This function unreads a buffer. That is, the data in the buffer is put back
in the incoming queue. This function is not affected by wxSocket flags.

If you use LastCount, it will always return {\it nbytes}.

If you use Error, it will always return FALSE.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{buffer}{Buffer to be unread.}

\docparam{nbytes}{Number of bytes.}

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns a reference to the current object.

%
% Discard
%
\membersection{wxSocketBase::Discard}\label{wxsocketbasediscard}

\func{wxSocketBase\&}{Discard}{\void}

This function simply deletes all bytes in the incoming queue. This function
always returns immediately and its operation is not affected by IO flags.

Use LastCount to see the number of bytes discarded.

If you use Error, it will always return FALSE.

% Wait functions
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\membersection{wxSocketBase::Wait}\label{wxsocketbasewait}

\func{bool}{Wait}{\param{long}{ seconds = -1}, \param{long}{ millisecond = 0}}

This function waits until one of the following conditions is true: there
is data available for reading; the output buffer is empty (you can send
new data); the connection has been lost; an incoming connection arrived
(only for servers); a connection request has completed (only for clients).
It is usually better to use the individual Wait functions to wait for the
required condition.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{seconds}{Number of seconds to wait. If -1, it will wait for the default timeout set with SetTimeout.}

\docparam{millisecond}{Number of milliseconds to wait.}

\wxheading{Return value}

\membersection{wxSocketBase::SetEventHandler}\label{wxsocketbaseseteventhandler}

\func{void}{SetEventHandler}{\param{wxEvtHandler\&}{ evt\_hdlr}, \param{int}{ id = -1}}

Sets an event handler to be called when a socket event occurs. The handler
will be called for those events for which notification is enabled with
SetNotify and Notify.

You can also specify a callback function to be called when an event occurs.
See \helpref{Callback}{wxsocketbasecallback} and \helpref{CallbackData}{wxsocketbasecallbackdata}.

\membersection{wxSocketBase::Callback}\label{wxsocketbasecallback}

\func{wxSocketBase::wxSockCbk}{Callback}{\param{wxSocketBase::wxSockCbk}{ callback}}

You can setup a callback function to be called when an event occurs. The function
will be called only for those events for which notification has been enabled
with Notify and SetNotify. The prototype of the callback must be as follows:

%
% Connect
%
\membersection{wxSocketClient::Connect}\label{wxsocketclientconnect}

\func{bool}{Connect}{\param{wxSockAddress\&}{ address}, \param{bool}{ wait = TRUE}}

Connects to a server using the specified address.

If {\it wait} is TRUE, Connect will wait until the connection completes
successfully, or until an event occurs. {\bf Warning !} This will block the GUI. 

If {\it wait} is FALSE, Connect will try to establish the connection and
return immediately, without blocking the GUI. When used this way, even if
Connect returns FALSE, the connection request can be completed later.
To detect this, use WaitConnection, or catch {\bf wxSOCKET\_CONNECTION}
events (for successful establishment) and {\bf wxSOCKET\_LOST} events
(for connection failure).

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{address}{Address of the server.}

\docparam{wait}{If TRUE, waits for the connection to be ready.}

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns TRUE if the connection is established and no error occurs.

If {\it wait} was TRUE, and Connect returns FALSE, an error occured
and the connection failed.

If {\it wait} was FALSE, and Connect returns FALSE, you should still
be prepared to handle the completion of this connection request, either
with WaitOnConnect or by watching {\bf wxSOCKET\_CONNECTION} and
{\bf wxSOCKET\_LOST} events.

\wxheading{Event table macros}

To process a socket event, use these event handler macros to direct input to member
functions that take a wxSocketEvent argument.

\func{}{wxSocketEvent}{\param{int}{ id = 0}}

Constructor.

\membersection{wxSocketEvent::Socket}\label{wxsocketeventsocket}

\constfunc{wxSocketBase *}{Socket}{\void}

Returns the socket object to which this event refers to. This makes
it possible to use the same event handler for different sockets.

\membersection{wxSocketEvent::SocketEvent}\label{wxsocketeventsocketevent}

\constfunc{wxSocketNotify}{SocketEvent}{\void}

Returns the socket event type.

\membersection{wxSocketServer::wxSocketServer}\label{wxsocketserverconstr}

\func{}{wxSocketServer}{\param{wxSockAddress\&}{ address}, \param{wxSockFlags}{ flags = wxSocketBase::NONE}}

Constructs a new wxSocketServer.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{address}{Specifies the local address for the server (e.g. port number).}

\docparam{flags}{Socket flags (See \helpref{wxSocketBase::SetFlags}{wxsocketbasesetflags})}

\membersection{wxSocketServer::\destruct{wxSocketServer}}

\func{}{\destruct{wxSocketServer}}{\void}

Destroys a wxSocketServer object (it doesn't close the accepted connections).

%
% Accept
%
\membersection{wxSocketServer::Accept}\label{wxsocketserveraccept}

\func{wxSocketBase *}{Accept}{\param{bool}{ wait = TRUE}}

Creates a new object wxSocketBase and accepts an incoming connection.

If {\it wait} is TRUE and there are no pending connections to be
accepted, it will wait for the next incoming connection to arrive.
{\bf Warning !} This will block the GUI.

If {\it wait} is FALSE, it will try to accept a pending connection
if there is one, but it will always return immediately without
blocking the GUI. If you want to use Accept in this way, you can
either check for incoming connections with WaitForAccept or watch
{\bf wxSOCKET\_CONNECTION} events, then call Accept once you know
that there is an incoming connection waiting to be accepted.

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns an opened socket connection, or NULL if an error occured or
if the {\it wait} parameter was FALSE and there were no pending
connections.

\membersection{wxSocketServer::AcceptWith}\label{wxsocketserveracceptwith}

\func{bool}{AcceptWith}{\param{wxSocketBase\&}{ socket}, \param{bool}{ wait = TRUE}}

Accept an incoming connection using the specified socket object.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{socket}{Socket to be initialized}

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE if an error occured or if the
{\it wait} parameter was FALSE and there were no pending
connections.

% WaitForAccept
%
\membersection{wxSocketServer::WaitForAccept}\label{wxsocketserverwaitforaccept}

\func{bool}{WaitForAccept}{\param{long}{ seconds = -1}, \param{long}{ millisecond = 0}}

This function waits for an incoming connection. Use it if you want to call
Accept or AcceptWith with {\it wait} set to FALSE, to detect when an incoming
connection is waiting to be accepted.

\wxheading{Parameters}

\docparam{seconds}{Number of seconds to wait. If -1, it will wait for the default timeout set with SetTimeout.}

\docparam{millisecond}{Number of milliseconds to wait.}

\wxheading{Return value}

Returns TRUE if an incoming connection arrived, FALSE if the timeout expired.
