\section{\class{wxStringOutputStream}}\label{wxstringoutputstream}

This class implements an output stream which writes data either to a
user-provided or internally allocated string. Note that currently this stream
does not support seeking but can tell its current position.

\membersection{wxStringOutputStream::wxStringOutputStream}\label{wxstringoutputstreamctor}

\func{}{wxStringOutputStream}{\param{wxString}{ *str = \texttt{NULL}}}

If the provided pointer is non-\texttt{NULL}, data will be written to it.
Otherwise, an internal string is used for the data written to this stream, use 
\helpref{GetString()}{wxstringoutputstreamgetstring} to get access to it.

If \arg{str} is used, data written to the stream is appended to the current
contents of it, i.e. the string is not cleared here. However if it is not
empty, the positions returned by \helpref{TellO}{wxoutputstreamtello} will be
offset by the initial string length, i.e. initial stream position will be the
initial length of the string and not $0$.


\membersection{wxStringOutputStream::GetString}\label{wxstringoutputstreamgetstring}

\constfunc{const wxString\&}{GetString}{\void}

Returns the string containing all the data written to the stream so far.
