\section{\class{wxGridCellWorker}}\label{wxgridcellworker}



wxGridCellWorker: common base class for wxGridCellRenderer and
wxGridCellEditor
NB: this is more an implementation convenience than a design issue, so this
class is not documented and is not public at all


\wxheading{Derived from}

No base class

\wxheading{Data structures}

\latexignore{\rtfignore{\wxheading{Members}}}


\membersection{wxGridCellWorker::wxGridCellWorker}\label{wxgridcellworkerwxgridcellworker}

\func{}{wxGridCellWorker}{\void}


\membersection{wxGridCellWorker::IncRef}\label{wxgridcellworkerincref}

\func{void}{IncRef}{\void}

this class is ref counted: it is created with ref count of 1, so
calling DecRef() once will delete it. Calling IncRef() allows to lock
it until the matching DecRef() is called


\membersection{wxGridCellWorker::DecRef}\label{wxgridcellworkerdecref}

\func{void}{DecRef}{\void}


\membersection{wxGridCellWorker::SetParameters}\label{wxgridcellworkersetparameters}

\func{void}{SetParameters}{\param{const wxString\& }{params}}

interpret renderer parameters: arbitrary string whose interpretatin is
left to the derived classes


\membersection{wxGridCellWorker::\destruct{wxGridCellWorker}}\label{wxgridcellworkerdtor}

\func{}{\destruct{wxGridCellWorker}}{\void}

virtual dtor for any base class - private because only DecRef() can
delete us
