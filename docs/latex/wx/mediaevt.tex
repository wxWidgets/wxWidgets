\begin{twocollist}\itemsep=0pt
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_MEDIA\_LOADED(id, func)}}{
Sent when a media has loaded enough data that it can start playing.}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_MEDIA\_STOP(id, func)}}{
Send when a media has switched to the wxMEDIASTATE\_STOPPED state.
You may be able to Veto this event to prevent it from stopping,
causing it to continue playing - even if it has reached that end of the media
(note that this may not have the desired effect - if you want to loop the
media, for example, catch the EVT\_MEDIA\_FINISHED and play there instead). }
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_MEDIA\_FINISHED(id, func)}}{
Sent when a media has finished playing in a \helpref{wxMediaCtrl}{wxmediactrl}.
}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_MEDIA\_STATECHANGED(id, func)}}{
Send when a media has switched its state (from any media state).
}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_MEDIA\_PLAY(id, func)}}{
Send when a media has switched to the wxMEDIASTATE\_PLAYING state.
}
\twocolitem{{\bf EVT\_MEDIA\_PAUSE(id, func)}}{
Send when a media has switched to the wxMEDIASTATE\_PAUSED state.
}
