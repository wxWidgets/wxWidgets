A wxGraphicsBrush is a native representation of a brush. It is used for filling a path on a graphics context. The contents are specific an private to the respective renderer. Instances are ref counted and can therefore be assigned as usual. The only way to get a valid instance is via a Create...Brush call on the graphics context or the renderer instance.
