\membersection{wxFilterOutputStream::wxFilterOutputStream}

\func{}{wxFilterOutputStream}{\param{wxOutputStream\&}{ stream}}

Initializes a "filter" stream. A filter stream has the capability of a normal
stream but it can be placed on the top of another stream. So, for example, it
can compress, crypt the datas which are passed to it and write them to another
stream.
