\section{\class{wxDynamicLibrary}}\label{wxdynamiclibrary}

wxDynamicLibrary is a class representing dynamically loadable library
(Windows DLL, shared library under Unix etc.). It is implemented as a wrapper
to \helpref{wxDllLoader}{wxdllloader}.

\wxheading{See also}

\helpref{wxDllLoader}{wxdllloader}

\membersection{wxDynamicLibrary::wxDynamicLibrary}\label{wxdynamiclibrarywxdynamiclibrary}

\func{}{wxDynamicLibrary}{\void}

\func{}{wxDynamicLibrary}{\param{const wxString\& }{name}}

Constructor. Second form calls \helpref{Load}{wxdynamiclibraryload}.

\membersection{wxDynamicLibrary::Detach}\label{wxdynamiclibrarydetach}

\func{wxDllType}{Detach}{\void}

Detaches this object from its library handle, i.e. the object will not unload
the library any longer in its destructor but it is now the callers
responsability to do this.

\membersection{wxDynamicLibrary::IsLoaded}\label{wxdynamiclibraryisloaded}

\constfunc{bool}{IsLoaded}{\void}

Returns true if the library was successfully loaded, false otherwise.

\membersection{wxDynamicLibrary::Load}\label{wxdynamiclibraryload}

\func{bool}{Load}{\param{const wxString\& }{name}}

Loads DLL into memory.

Returns true if the library was successfully loaded, false otherwise.

\membersection{wxDynamicLibrary::Unload}\label{wxdynamiclibraryunload}

\func{void}{Unload}{\void}

Unloads the library from memory.

\membersection{wxDynamicLibrary::GetSymbol}\label{wxdynamiclibrarygetsymbol}

\constfunc{void*}{GetSymbol}{\param{const wxString\& }{name}}

Returns pointer to symbol {\it name} in the library or NULL if the library
contains no such symbol.
