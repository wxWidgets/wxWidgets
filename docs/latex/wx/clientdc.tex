\section{\class{wxClientDC}}\label{wxclientdc}

A wxClientDC must be constructed if an application wishes to paint on the
client area of a window from outside an {\bf OnPaint} event.
This should normally be constructed as a temporary stack object; don't store
a wxClientDC object.

To draw on a window from within {\bf OnPaint}, construct a \helpref{wxPaintDC}{wxpaintdc} object.

To draw on the whole window including decorations, construct a \helpref{wxWindowDC}{wxwindowdc} object
(Windows only).
