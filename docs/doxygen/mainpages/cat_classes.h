@section page_class_cat_winlayout Window Layout

There are two different systems for laying out windows (and dialogs in
particular). One is based upon so-called sizers and it requires less typing,
thinking and calculating and will in almost all cases produce dialogs looking
equally well on all platforms, the other is based on so-called constraints and
is deprecated, though still available.
