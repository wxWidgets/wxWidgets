# This bash script regenerates the HTML doxygen version of the
# wxWidgets manual and adjusts the doxygen log to make it more
# readable.
#
# Usage:
#    ./regen.sh [html|chm|xml|latex|all]
#
# Pass "x" to regen only the X output format and "all" to regen them all.
# If no arguments are passed all formats are regenerated
# (just like passing "all").
#
