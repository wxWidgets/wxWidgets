@page overview_grid wxGrid Overview

@tableofcontents

wxGrid and its related classes are used for displaying and editing tabular
data. wxGrid supports custom attributes for the table cells, allowing to
completely customize its appearance and uses a separate grid table
(wxGridTableBase-derived) class for the data management meaning that it can be
used to display arbitrary amounts of data.



@section overview_grid_simpleexample Getting Started

For simple applications you need only refer to the wxGrid class in your code.
This example shows how you might create a grid in a frame or dialog constructor
and illustrates some of the formatting functions.

@code
// Create a wxGrid object

grid = new wxGrid( this,
                    -1,
                    wxPoint( 0, 0 ),
                    wxSize( 400, 300 ) );

// Then we call CreateGrid to set the dimensions of the grid
// (100 rows and 10 columns in this example)
grid->CreateGrid( 100, 10 );

// We can set the sizes of individual rows and columns
// in pixels
grid->SetRowSize( 0, 60 );
grid->SetColSize( 0, 120 );

// And set grid cell contents as strings
grid->SetCellValue( 0, 0, "wxGrid is good" );

// We can specify that some cells are read->only
grid->SetCellValue( 0, 3, "This is read->only" );
grid->SetReadOnly( 0, 3 );

// Colours can be specified for grid cell contents
grid->SetCellValue(3, 3, "green on grey");
grid->SetCellTextColour(3, 3, *wxGREEN);
grid->SetCellBackgroundColour(3, 3, *wxLIGHT_GREY);

// We can specify the some cells will store numeric
// values rather than strings. Here we set grid column 5
// to hold floating point values displayed with width of 6
// and precision of 2
grid->SetColFormatFloat(5, 6, 2);
grid->SetCellValue(0, 6, "3.1415");
@endcode

Here is a list of classes related to wxGrid:

@li wxGrid: The main grid control class itself.
@li wxGridTableBase: The base class for grid data provider.
@li wxGridStringTable: Simple wxGridTableBase implementation supporting only
    string data items and storing them all in memory (hence suitable for not
    too large grids only).
@li wxGridCellAttr: A cell attribute, allowing to customize its appearance as
    well as the renderer and editor used for displaying and editing it.
@li wxGridCellAttrProvider: The object responsible for storing and retrieving
    the cell attributes.
@li wxGridColLabelWindow: The window showing the grid columns labels.
@li wxGridRowLabelWindow: The window showing the grid rows labels.
@li wxGridCornerLabelWindow: The window used in the upper left grid corner.
@li wxGridWindow: The window representing the main part of the grid.
@li wxGridCellRenderer: Base class for objects used to display a cell value.
@li wxGridCellStringRenderer: Renderer showing the cell as a text string.
@li wxGridCellNumberRenderer: Renderer showing the cell as an integer number.
@li wxGridCellFloatRenderer: Renderer showing the cell as a floating point
    number.
@li wxGridCellBoolRenderer: Renderer showing the cell as checked or unchecked
    box.
@li wxGridCellEditor: Base class for objects used to edit the cell value.
@li wxGridCellStringEditor: Editor for cells containing text strings.
@li wxGridCellNumberEditor: Editor for cells containing integer numbers.
@li wxGridCellFloatEditor: Editor for cells containing floating point numbers.
@li wxGridCellBoolEditor: Editor for boolean-valued cells.
@li wxGridCellChoiceEditor: Editor allowing to choose one of the predefined
    strings (and possibly enter new one).
@li wxGridEvent: The event sent by most of wxGrid actions.
@li wxGridSizeEvent: The special event sent when a grid column or row is
    resized.
@li wxGridRangeSelectEvent: The special event sent when a range of cells is
    selected in the grid.
@li wxGridEditorCreatedEvent: The special event sent when a cell editor is
    created.
@li wxGridSelection: The object efficiently representing the grid selection.
@li wxGridTypeRegistry: Contains information about the data types supported by
    the grid.



@section overview_grid_resizing Column and Row Sizes

@b NB: This section will discuss the resizing of wxGrid rows only to avoid
repetitions but everything in it also applies to grid columns, just replace @c
Row in the method names with @c Col.

Initially all wxGrid rows have the same height, which can be modified for all
of them at once using wxGrid::SetDefaultRowSize(). However, unlike simpler
controls such as wxListBox or wxListCtrl, wxGrid also allows its rows to be
individually resized to have their own height using wxGrid::SetRowSize() (as a
special case, a row may be hidden entirely by setting its size to 0, which is
done by a helper wxGrid::HideRow() method). It is also possible to resize a row
to fit its contents with wxGrid::AutoSizeRow() or do it for all rows at once
with wxGrid::AutoSizeRows().

Additionally, by default the user can also drag the row separator lines to
resize the rows interactively. This can be forbidden completely by calling
wxGrid::DisableDragRowSize() or just for the individual rows using
wxGrid::DisableRowResize().

If you do allow the user to resize the grid rows, it may be a good idea to save
their heights and restore it when the grid is recreated the next time (possibly
during a next program execution): the functions wxGrid::GetRowSizes() and
wxGrid::SetRowSizes() can help with this, you will just need to serialize
wxGridSizesInfo structure returned by the former in some way and deserialize it
back before calling the latter.
