This document describes the format of XRC resource files, as used by wxXmlResource.


<hr>


@section overview_xrcformat_overview Overview

XRC file is a XML file with all of its elements in the
@c http://www.wxwidgets.org/wxxrc namespace. For backward compatibility,
@c http://www.wxwindows.org/wxxrc namespace is accepted as well (and treated
as identical to @c http://www.wxwidgets.org/wxxrc), but it shouldn't be used
in new XRC files.

XRC file contains definitions for one or more @em objects -- typically
windows. The objects may themselves contain child objects.

Objects defined at the top level, under the
@ref overview_xrcformat_root "root element", can be accessed using
wxXmlResource::LoadDialog() and other LoadXXX methods. They must have
@c name attribute that is used as LoadXXX's argument (see
@ref overview_xrcformat_object for details).

Child objects are not directly accessible via wxXmlResource, they can only
be accessed using XRCCTRL().


@section overview_xrcformat_root Resource Root Element

The root element is always @c \<resource\>. It has one optional attribute, @c
version. If set, it specifies version of the file. In absence of @c version
attribute, the default is @c "0.0.0.0".

The version consists of four integers separated by periods.  The first three
components are major, minor and release number of the wxWidgets release when
the change was introduced, the last one is revision number and is 0 for the
first incompatible change in given wxWidgets release, 1 for the second and so
on.  The version changes only if there was an incompatible change introduced;
merely adding new kind of objects does not constitute incompatible change.

At the time of writing, the latest version is @c "2.5.3.0".

Note that even though @c version attribute is optional, it should always be
specified to take advantage of the latest capabilities:

@code
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<resource xmlns="http://www.wxwidgets.org/wxxrc" version="2.5.3.0">
    ...
</resource>
@endcode

@c \<resource\> may have arbitrary number of
@ref overview_xrcformat_objects "object elements" as its children; they are referred
to as @em toplevel objects in the rest of this document. Unlike objects defined
deeper in the hierarchy, toplevel objects @em must have their @c name attribute
set and it must be set to a value unique among root's children.



@section overview_xrcformat_objects Defining Objects

@subsection overview_xrcformat_object Object Element

The @c \<object\> element represents a single object (typically a GUI element)
and it usually maps directly to a wxWidgets class instance. It has one
mandatory attribute, @c class, and optional @c name and @c subclass attributes.

The @c class attribute must always be present, it tells XRC what wxWidgets
object should be created and by which wxXmlResourceHandler.

@c name is the identifier used to identify the object. This name serves three
purposes:

 -# It is used by wxXmlResource's various LoadXXX() methods to find the
    resource by name passed as argument.
 -# wxWindow's name (see wxWindow::GetName()) is set to it.
 -# Numeric ID of a window or menu item is derived from the name.
    If the value represents an integer (in decimal notation), it is used for
    the numeric ID unmodified.  If it is one of the wxID_XXX literals defined
    by wxWidgets (see @ref page_stockitems), its respective value is used.
    Otherwise, the name is transformed into dynamically generated ID. See
    wxXmlResource::GetXRCID() for more information.

Name attributes must be unique at the top level (where the name is used to
load resources) and should be unique among all controls within the same
toplevel window (wxDialog, wxFrame).

The @c subclass attribute optional name of class whose constructor will be
called instead of the constructor for "class".
See @ref overview_xrcformat_extending_subclass for more details.

@c \<object\> element may -- and almost always do -- have children elements.
These come in two varieties:

 -# Object's properties. A @em property is a value describing part of object's
    behaviour, for example the "label" property on wxButton defines its label.
    In the most common form, property is a single element with text content
    ("\<label\>Cancel\</label\>"), but they may use nested subelements too (e.g.
    @ref overview_xrcformat_type_font "font property"). A property can only be
    listed once in an object's definition.
 -# Child objects. Window childs, sizers, sizer items or notebook pages
    are all examples of child objects. They are represented using nested
    @c \<object\> elements and are can be repeated more than once. The specifics
    of which object classes are allowed as children are class-specific and
    are documented below in @ref overview_xrcformat_controls.

Example:
@code
<object class="wxDialog" name="example_dialog">
    <!-- properties: -->
    <title>Non-Derived Dialog Example</title>
    <centered>1</centered>
    <!-- child objects: -->
    <object class="wxBoxSizer">
        <orient>wxVERTICAL</orient>
        <cols>1</cols>
        <rows>0</rows>
        ...
    </object>
</object>
@endcode


@subsection overview_xrcformat_object_ref Object References

Anywhere an @c \<object\> element can be used, @c \<object_ref\> may be used
instead. @c \<object_ref\> is a @em reference to another named (i.e. with the
@c name attribute) @c \<object\> element. It has one mandatory attribute,
@c ref, with value containing the name of a named @c \<object\> element. When an
@c \<object_ref\> is encountered, a copy of the referenced @c \<object\> element
is made in place of @c \<object_ref\> occurrence and processed as usual.

For example, the following code:
@code
<object class="wxDialog" name="my_dlg">
    ...
</object>
<object_ref name="my_dlg_alias" ref="my_dlg"/>
@endcode
is equivalent to
@code
<object class="wxDialog" name="my_dlg">
    ...
</object>
<object class="wxDialog" name="my_dlg_alias">
    ... <!-- same as in my_dlg -->
</object>
@endcode

Additionally, it is possible to override some parts of the referenced object
in the @c \<object_ref\> pointing to it. This is useful for putting repetitive
parts of XRC definitions into a template that can be reused and customized in
several places. The two parts are merged as follows:

 -# The referred object is used as the initial content.
 -# All attributes set on @c \<object_ref\> are added to it.
 -# All child elements of @c \<object_ref\> are scanned. If an element with
    the same name (and, if specified, the @c name attribute too) is found
    in the referred object, they are recursively merged.
 -# Child elements in @c \<object_ref\> that do not have a match in the referred
    object are appended to the list of children of the resulting element by
    default. Optionally, they may have @c insert_at attribute with two possible
    values, "begin" or "end". When set to "begin", the element is prepended to
    the list of children instead of appended.

For example, "my_dlg" in this snippet:
@code
<object class="wxDialog" name="template">
    <title>Dummy dialog</title>
    <size>400,400</size>
</object>
<object_ref ref="template" name="my_dlg">
    <title>My dialog</title>
    <centered>1</centered>
</object>
@endcode
is identical to:
@code
<object class="wxDialog" name="my_dlg">
    <title>My dialog</title>
    <size>400,400</size>
    <centered>1</centered>
</object>
@endcode


@section overview_xrcformat_datatypes Data Types

There are several property data types that are frequently reused by different
properties. Rather than describing their format in the documentation of
every property, we list commonly used types in this section and document
their format.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_bool Boolean

Boolean values are expressed using either "1" literal (true) or "0" (false).


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_float Floating-point value

Floating point values use POSIX (C locale) formatting -- decimal separator
is "." regardless of the locale.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_colour Colour

Colour specification can be either any string colour representation accepted
by wxColour::Set() or any wxSYS_COLOUR_XXX symbolic name accepted by
wxSystemSettings::GetColour(). In particular, the following forms are supported:

@li named colours from wxColourDatabase
@li HTML-like "#rrggbb" syntax (but not "#rgb")
@li CSS-style "rgb(r,g,b)" and "rgba(r,g,b,a)"
@li wxSYS_COLOUR_XXX symbolic names

Some examples:
@code
<fg>red</fg>
<fg>#ff0000</fg>
<fg>rgb(255,0,0)</fg>
<fg>wxSYS_COLOUR_HIGHLIGHT</fg>
@endcode


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_size Size

Sizes and positions have the form of string with two comma-separated integer
components, with optional "d" suffix. Semi-formally:

  size := x "," y ["d"]

where x and y are integers. Either of the components (or both) may be "-1" to
signify default value. As a shortcut, empty string is equivalent to "-1,-1"
(= wxDefaultSize or wxDefaultPosition).

When the "d" suffix is used, integer values are interpreted as
@ref wxWindow::ConvertDialogToPixels() "dialog units" in the parent window.

Examples:
@code
42,-1
100,100
100,50d
@endcode

@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_pos Position

Same as @ref overview_xrcformat_type_size.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_dimension Dimension

Similarly to @ref overview_xrcformat_type_size "sizes", dimensions are expressed
as integers with optional "d" suffix. When "d" suffix is used, the integer
preceding it is interpreted as dialog units in the parent window.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_text Text

String properties use several escape sequences that are translated according to
the following table:
@beginDefList
@itemdef{ "_", "&" (used for accelerators in wxWidgets) }
@itemdef{ "__", "_" }
@itemdef{ "\n", line break }
@itemdef{ "\r", carriage return }
@itemdef{ "\t", tab }
@itemdef{ "\\", "\" }
@endDefList

By default, the text is translated using wxLocale::GetTranslation() before
it is used. This can be disabled either globally by not passing
wxXRC_USE_LOCALE to wxXmlResource constructor, or by setting the @c translate
attribute on the property node to "0":
@code
<!-- this is not translated: -->
<label translate="0">_Unix</label>
<!-- but this is: -->
<help>Use Unix-style newlines</help>
@endcode

@note Even though the "_" character is used instead of "&" for accelerators,
      it is still possible to use "&". The latter has to be encoded as "&amp;",
      though, so using "_" is more convenient.

@see @ref overview_xrcformat_pre_v2530, @ref overview_xrcformat_pre_v2301


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_text_notrans Non-Translatable Text

Like @ref overview_xrcformat_type_text, but the text is never translated and
@c translate attribute cannot be used.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_string String

An unformatted string. Unlike with @ref overview_xrcformat_type_text, no escaping
or translations are done.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_url URL

Any URL accepted by wxFileSystem (typically relative to XRC file's location,
but can be absolute too). Unlike with @ref overview_xrcformat_type_text, no escaping
or translations are done.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_bitmap Bitmap

Bitmap properties contain specification of a single bitmap or icon. In the most
basic form, their text value is simply a relative filename (or another
wxFileSystem URL) of the bitmap to use. For example:
@code
<object class="tool" name="wxID_NEW">
    <tooltip>New</tooltip>
    <bitmap>new.png</bitmap>
</object>
@endcode
The value is interpreted as path relative to the location of XRC file where the
reference occurs.

Alternatively, it is possible to specify the bitmap using wxArtProvider IDs.
In this case, the property element has no textual value (filename) and instead
has the @c stock_id XML attribute that contains stock art ID as accepted by
wxArtProvider::GetBitmap(). This can be either custom value (if the app uses
app-specific art provider) or one of the predefined wxART_XXX constants.

Optionally, @c stock_client attribute may be specified too and contain one of
the predefined wxArtClient values. If it is not specified, the default client
ID most appropriate in the context where the bitmap is referenced will be used.
In most cases, specifying @c stock_client is not needed.

Examples of stock bitmaps usage:
@code
<bitmap stock_id="fixed-width"/>        <!-- custom app-specific art -->
<bitmap stock_id="wxART_FILE_OPEN"/>    <!-- standard art -->
@endcode

Specifying the bitmap directly and using @c stock_id are mutually exclusive.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_style Style

Style properties (such as window's style or sizer flags) use syntax similar to
C++: the style value is OR-combination of individual flags. Symbolic names
identical to those used in C++ code are used for the flags. Flags are separated
with "|" (whitespace is allowed but not required around it).

The flags that are allowed for a given property are context-dependent.

Examples:
@code
<style>wxCAPTION|wxSYSTEM_MENU | wxRESIZE_BORDER</style>
<exstyle>wxDIALOG_EX_CONTEXTHELP</exstyle>
@endcode


@subsection overview_xrcformat_type_font Font

XRC uses similar, but more flexible, abstract description of fonts to that
used by wxFont class. A font can be described either in terms of its elementary
properties, or it can be derived from one of system fonts.

The font property element is "composite" element: unlike majority of
properties, it doesn't have text value but contains several child elements
instead. These children are handled in the same way as object properties
and can be one of the following "sub-properties":

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}
@row3col{size, unsigned integer,
    Pixel size of the font (default: wxNORMAL_FONT's size or @c sysfont's
    size if the @c sysfont property is used.}
@row3col{style, enum,
    One of "normal", "italic" or "slant" (default: normal).}
@row3col{weight, enum,
    One of "normal", "bold" or "light" (default: normal).}
@row3col{family, enum,
    One of "roman", "script", "decorative", "swiss", "modern" or "teletype"
    (default: roman).}
@row3col{underlined, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bool,
    Whether the font should be underlined (default: 0).}
@row3col{face, ,
    Comma-separated list of face names; the first one available is used
    (default: unspecified).}
@row3col{encoding, ,
    Charset of the font, unused in Unicode build), as string
    (default: unspecified).}
@row3col{sysfont, ,
    Symbolic name of system standard font(one of wxSYS_*_FONT constants).}
@row3col{relativesize, float,
    Float, font size relative to chosen system font's size; can only be
    used when 'sysfont' is used and when 'size' is not used.}
@endTable

All of them are optional, if they are missing, appropriate wxFont default is
used. If the @c sysfont property is used, then the defaults are taken from it
instead.

Examples:
@code
<font>
    <!-- fixed font: Arial if available, fall back to Helvetica -->
    <face>arial,helvetica</face>
    <size>12</size>
</font>

<font>
    <!-- enlarged, enboldened standard font: -->
    <sysfont>wxSYS_DEFAULT_GUI_FONT</sysfont>
    <weight>bold</weight>
    <relativesize>1.5</relativesize>
</font>
@endcode


@section overview_xrcformat_windows Controls and Windows

pseudo-class (similarly to @ref xrc_wxnotebook "wxNotebook" and its
@c notebookpage) and one child object of the @ref xrc_wximagelist class.
@c choicebookpage objects have the following properties:

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}

@row3col{scrollrate, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_size,
    Scroll rate in @em x and @em y directions (default: not set;
    required if the window has a sizer child).}
@endTable

wxScrolledWindow may have optional children: either exactly one
@ref overview_xrcformat_sizers "sizer" child or any number of non-toplevel window
objects. If sizer child is used, wxSizer::FitInside() is used (instead of
wxSizer::Fit() as usual) and so the children don't determine scrolled window's
minimal size, they only affect @em virtual size. Usually, both @c scrollrate
and either @c size or @c minsize on containing sizer item should be used
in this case.


@subsubsection xrc_wxsimplehtmllistbox wxSimpleHtmlListBox

wxSimpleHtmlListBox has same properties as @ref xrc_wxlistbox "wxListBox".
The only difference is that the text contained in @c \<item\> elements is
HTML markup. Note that the markup has to be escaped:

@code
<object class="wxSimpleHtmlListBox">
    <content>
        <item>&lt;b&gt;Bold&lt;/b&gt; Milk</item>
    </content>
</object>
@endcode

(X)HTML markup elements cannot be included directly:

@code
<object class="wxSimpleHtmlListBox">
    <content>
        <!-- This is incorrect, doesn't work! -->
        <item><b>Bold</b> Milk</item>

    to 1 to disable this behaviour (default: 0).}
@endTable

A toolbar can have one or more child objects of any wxControl-derived class or
one of two pseudo-classes: @c separator or @c tool.

The @c separator pseudo-class is used to insert separators into the toolbar and
has neither properties nor children. Similarly, the @c space pseudo-class is
used for stretchable spaces (see wxToolBar::AddStretchableSpace(), new since
wxWidgets 2.9.1).

The @c tool pseudo-class objects specify toolbar buttons and have the following
properties:

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}
@row3col{bitmap, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bitmap,
    Tool's bitmap (required).}
@row3col{bitmap2, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bitmap,
    Bitmap for disabled tool (default: derived from @c bitmap).}
@row3col{label, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_text,
    Label to display on the tool (default: no label).}
@row3col{radio, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bool,
     Item's kind is wxITEM_RADIO (default: 0)?}
@row3col{toggle, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bool,
     Item's kind is wxITEM_CHECK (default: 0)?}
@row3col{dropdown, see below,
     Item's kind is wxITEM_DROPDOWN (default: 0)? (only available since wxWidgets 2.9.0)}
@row3col{tooltip, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_text,
    Tooltip to use for the tool (default: none).}
@row3col{longhelp, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_text,
    Help text shown in statusbar when the mouse is on the tool (default: none).}
@row3col{disabled, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bool,
     Is the tool initially disabled (default: 0)?}
@endTable

The presence of a @c dropdown property indicates that the tool is of type
wxITEM_DROPDOWN. It must be either empty or contain exactly one @ref
xrc_wxmenu child object defining the drop-down button associated menu.

Notice that @c radio, @c toggle and @c dropdown are mutually exclusive.

Children that are neither @c tool nor @c separator must be instances of classes
derived from wxControl and are added to the toolbar using
wxToolBar::AddControl().

Example:
@code
<object class="wxToolBar">
    <style>wxTB_FLAT|wxTB_NODIVIDER</style>
    <object class="tool" name="foo">
        <bitmap>foo.png</bitmap>
        <label>Foo</label>
    </object>
    <object class="tool" name="bar">
        <bitmap>bar.png</bitmap>
        <label>Bar</label>
    </object>
    <object class="separator"/>
    <object class="tool" name="view_auto">
        <bitmap>view.png</bitmap>
        <label>View</label>
        <dropdown>

@subsubsection xrc_wxtoolbook wxToolbook

A toolbook can have one or more child objects of the @c toolbookpage
pseudo-class (similarly to @ref xrc_wxnotebook "wxNotebook" and its
@c notebookpage) and one child object of the @ref xrc_wximagelist class.
@c toolbookpage objects have the following properties:

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}
@row3col{label, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_text,
     Sheet page's title (required).}
@row3col{bitmap, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bitmap,
     Bitmap shown alongside the label (default: none).}
@row3col{image, integer,
    The zero-based index of the image associated with the item
    into the image list.}
@row3col{selected, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bool,
     Is the page selected initially (only one page can be selected; default: 0)?}
@endTable

Each @c toolbookpage has exactly one non-toplevel window as its child.


@subsubsection xrc_wxtreectrl wxTreeCtrl

A treectrl can have one child object of the @ref xrc_wximagelist class.

No additional properties.


@subsubsection xrc_wxtreebook wxTreebook

A treebook can have one or more child objects of the @c treebookpage
pseudo-class (similarly to @ref xrc_wxnotebook "wxNotebook" and its
@c notebookpage) and one child object of the @ref xrc_wximagelist class.
@c treebookpage objects have the following properties:

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}
@row3col{depth, integer,
     Page's depth in the labels tree (required; see below).}
@row3col{label, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_text,
     Sheet page's title (required).}
@row3col{bitmap, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bitmap,
     Bitmap shown alongside the label (default: none).}
@row3col{image, integer,
    The zero-based index of the image associated with the item
    into the image list.}
@row3col{selected, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bool,
     Is the page selected initially (only one page can be selected; default: 0)?}
@row3col{expanded, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bool,
    If set to 1, the page is initially expanded. By default all pages are
    initially collapsed.}
@endTable

Each @c treebookpage has exactly one non-toplevel window as its child.

The tree of labels is not described using nested @c treebookpage objects, but
using the @em depth property. Toplevel pages have depth 0, their child pages
have depth 1 and so on. A @c treebookpage's label is inserted as child of
the latest preceding page with depth equal to @em depth-1. For example, this
XRC markup:

@code
<object class="wxTreebook">
  ...
  <object class="treebookpage">
    <depth>0</depth>
    <label>Page 1</label>
    <object class="wxPanel">...</object>
  </object>
  <object class="treebookpage">
    <depth>1</depth>
    <label>Subpage 1A</label>
    <object class="wxPanel">...</object>
  </object>
  <object class="treebookpage">
    <depth>2</depth>
    <label>Subsubpage 1</label>
    <object class="wxPanel">...</object>
  </object>
  <object class="treebookpage">
    <depth>1</depth>
    <label>Subpage 1B</label>
    <object class="wxPanel">...</object>
  </object>
  <object class="treebookpage">
    <depth>2</depth>
    <label>Subsubpage 2</label>
    <object class="wxPanel">...</object>
  </object>
  <object class="treebookpage">
    <depth>0</depth>
    <label>Page 2</label>
    <object class="wxPanel">...</object>
  </object>
</object>
@endcode

corresponds to the following tree of labels:

 - Page 1
   - Subpage 1A
     - Subsubpage 1
   - Subpage 1B
     - Subsubpage 2
 - Page 2


@subsubsection xrc_wxwizard wxWizard

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}
@row3col{bitmap, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bitmap,
    Bitmap to display on the left side of the wizard (default: none).}
@endTable

A wizard object can have one or more child objects of the wxWizardPage or
wxWizardPageSimple classes. They both support the following properties
(in addition to @ref overview_xrcformat_std_props):

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}
@row3col{bitmap, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_bitmap,
    Page-specific bitmap (default: none).}
@endTable

wxWizardPageSimple pages are automatically chained together; wxWizardPage pages
transitions must be handled programmatically.


@section overview_xrcformat_sizers Sizers

Sizers are handled slightly differently in XRC resources than they are in
wxWindow hierarchy. wxWindow's sizers hierarchy is parallel to the wxWindow
children hierarchy: child windows are children of their parent window and
the sizer (or sizers) form separate hierarchy attached to the window with
wxWindow::SetSizer().

In XRC, the two hierarchies are merged together: sizers are children of other
sizers or windows and they can contain child window objects.

If a sizer is child of a window object in the resource, it must be the only
child and it will be attached to the parent with wxWindow::SetSizer().
Additionally, if the window doesn't have its size explicitly set,
wxSizer::Fit() is used to resize the window. If the parent window is
toplevel window, wxSizer::SetSizeHints() is called to set its hints.

A sizer object can have one or more child objects of one of two pseudo-classes:
@c sizeritem or @c spacer (see @ref overview_xrcformat_wxstddialogbuttonsizer for
an exception). The former specifies an element (another sizer or a window)
to include in the sizer, the latter adds empty space to the sizer.

@c sizeritem objects have exactly one child object: either another sizer
object, or a window object. @c spacer objects don't have any children, but
they have one property:

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}
@row3col{size, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_size, Size of the empty space (required).}
@endTable

Both @c sizeritem and @c spacer objects can have any of the following
properties:

@beginTable
@hdr3col{property, type, description}
@row3col{option, integer,
    The "option" value for sizers. Used by wxBoxSizer to set proportion of
    the item in the growable direction (default: 0).}
@row3col{flag, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_style,
    wxSizerItem flags (default: 0).}
@row3col{border, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_dimension,
    Size of the border around the item (directions are specified in flags)
    (default: 0).}
@row3col{minsize, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_size,
    Minimal size of this item (default: no min size).}
@row3col{ratio, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_size,
    Item ratio, see wxSizer::SetRatio() (default: no ratio).}
@row3col{cellpos, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_pos,
    (wxGridBagSizer only) Position, see wxGBSizerItem::SetPos() (required). }
@row3col{cellspan, @ref overview_xrcformat_type_size,
    (wxGridBagSizer only) Span, see wxGBSizerItem::SetSpan() (required). }

@section overview_xrcformat_other_objects Other Objects

In addition to describing UI elements, XRC files can contain non-windows
objects such as bitmaps or icons. This is a concession to Windows developers
used to storing them in Win32 resources.

Note that unlike Win32 resources, bitmaps included in XRC files are @em not
embedded in the XRC file itself. XRC file only contains a reference to another
file with bitmap data.

@subsection overview_xrcformat_bitmap wxBitmap

Bitmaps are stored in @c \<object\> element with class set to @c wxBitmap. Such
bitmaps can then be loaded using wxXmlResource::LoadBitmap(). The content of
the element is exactly same as in the case of
@ref overview_xrcformat_type_bitmap "bitmap properties", except that toplevel
@c \<object\> is used.

For example, instead of:
@code
<bitmap>mybmp.png</bitmap>
<bitmap stock_id="wxART_NEW"/>
@endcode
toplevel wxBitmap resources would look like:
@code
<object class="wxBitmap" name="my_bitmap">mybmp.png</object>
<object class="wxBitmap" name="my_new_bitmap" stock_id="wxART_NEW"/>
@endcode


@subsection overview_xrcformat_icon wxIcon

wxIcon resources are identical to @ref overview_xrcformat_bitmap "wxBitmap ones",
except that the class is @c wxIcon.


@section overview_xrcformat_platform Platform Specific Content

It is possible to conditionally process parts of XRC files on some platforms
only and ignore them on other platforms. @em Any element in XRC file, be it
toplevel or arbitrarily nested one, can have the @c platform attribute. When
used, @c platform contains |-separated list of platforms that this element
should be processed on. It is filtered out and ignored on any other platforms.

Possible elemental values are:
@beginDefList
@itemdef{ @c win, Windows }
@itemdef{ @c mac, Mac OS X (or Mac Classic in wxWidgets version supporting it) }
@itemdef{ @c unix, Any Unix platform @em except OS X }
@itemdef{ @c os2, OS/2 }
@endDefList

Examples:
@code
<label platform="win">Windows</label>
<label platform="unix">Unix</label>
<label platform="mac">Mac OS X</label>
<help platform="mac|unix">Not a Windows machine</help>
@endcode



@section overview_xrcformat_idranges ID Ranges

Usually you won't care what value the XRCID macro returns for the ID of an
object. Sometimes though it is convenient to have a range of IDs that are
guaranteed to be consecutive. An example of this would be connecting a group of
similar controls to the same event handler.

The following XRC fragment 'declares' an ID range called  @em foo and another
called @em bar; each with some items.

@code
    <object class="wxButton" name="foo[start]">
    <object class="wxButton" name="foo[end]">
    <object class="wxButton" name="foo[2]">
    ...
    <object class="wxButton" name="bar[0]">
    <object class="wxButton" name="bar[2]">
    <object class="wxButton" name="bar[1]">
    ...
<ids-range name="foo" />
<ids-range name="bar" size="30" start="10000" />
@endcode

For the range foo, no @em size or @em start parameters were given, so the size
will be calculated from the number of range items, and IDs allocated by
wxWindow::NewControlId (so they'll be negative). Range bar asked for a size of
30, so this will be its minimum size: should it have more items, the range will
automatically expand to fit them. It specified a start ID of 10000, so
XRCID("bar[0]") will be 10000, XRCID("bar[1]") 10001 etc. Note that if you
choose to supply a start value it must be positive, and it's your
responsibility to avoid clashes.

For every ID range, the first item can be referenced either as
<em>rangename</em>[0] or <em>rangename</em>[start]. Similarly
<em>rangename</em>[end] is the last item. Using [start] and [end] is more
descriptive in e.g. a Bind() event range or a @em for loop, and they don't have
to be altered whenever the number of items changes.

Whether a range has positive or negative IDs, [start] is always a smaller
number than [end]; so code like this works as expected:

@code
for (int n=XRCID("foo[start]"); n < XRCID("foo[end]"); ++n)
    ...
@endcode

ID ranges can be seen in action in the <em>objref</em> dialog section of the
@sample{xrc}.

@note
@li All the items in an ID range must be contained in the same XRC file.
@li You can't use an ID range in a situation where static initialisation
occurs; in particular, they won't work as expected in an event table. This is
because the event table's IDs are set to their integer values before the XRC
file is loaded, and aren't subsequently altered when the XRCID value changes.

@since 2.9.2

@section overview_xrcformat_extending Extending the XRC Format

The XRC format is designed to be extensible and allows specifying and loading
custom controls. The three available mechanisms are described in the rest of
this section in the order of increasing complexity.

@subsection overview_xrcformat_extending_subclass Subclassing

The simplest way to add custom controls is to set the @c subclass attribute
of @c \<object\> element:

@code
<object name="my_value" class="wxTextCtrl" subclass="MyTextCtrl">
  <style>wxTE_MULTILINE</style>
  ...etc., setup wxTextCtrl as usual...
</object>
@endcode

In that case, wxXmlResource will create an instance of the specified subclass
(@c MyTextCtrl in the example above) instead of the class (@c wxTextCtrl above)
when loading the resource. However, the rest of the object's loading (calling
its Create() method, setting its properties, loading any children etc.)
will proceed in @em exactly the same way as it would without @c subclass
attribute. In other words, this approach is only sufficient when the custom
class is just a small modification (e.g. overridden methods or customized
events handling) of an already supported classes.

The subclass must satisfy a number of requirements:

 -# It must be derived from the class specified in @c class attribute.
 -# It must be visible in wxWidget's pseudo-RTTI mechanism, i.e. there must be
    a DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLASS() entry for it.
 -# It must support two-phase creation. In particular, this means that it has
    to have default constructor.
 -# It cannot provide custom Create() method and must be constructible using
    base @c class' Create() method (this is because XRC will call Create() of
    @c class, not @c subclass). In other words, @em creation of the control
    must not be customized.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_extending_unknown Unknown Objects

A more flexible solution is to put a @em placeholder in the XRC file and
replace it with custom control after the resource is loaded. This is done by
using the @c unknown pseudo-class:

@code
<object class="unknown" name="my_placeholder"/>
@endcode

The placeholder is inserted as dummy wxPanel that will hold custom control in
it. At runtime, after the resource is loaded and a window created from it
(using e.g. wxXmlResource::LoadDialog()), use code must call
wxXmlResource::AttachUnknownControl() to insert the desired control into
placeholder container.

This method makes it possible to insert controls that are not known to XRC at
all, but it's also impossible to configure the control in XRC description in
any way. The only properties that can be specified are
the @ref overview_xrcformat_std_props "standard window properties".

@note @c unknown class cannot be combined with @c subclass attribute,
      they are mutually exclusive.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_extending_custom Adding Custom Classes

Finally, XRC allows adding completely new classes in addition to the ones
listed in this document. A class for which wxXmlResourceHandler is implemented
can be used as first-class object in XRC simply by passing class name as the
value of @c class attribute:

@code
<object name="my_ctrl" class="MyWidget">
  <my_prop>foo</my_prop>
  ...etc., whatever MyWidget handler accepts...
</object>
@endcode

The only requirements on the class are that
 -# the class must derive from wxObject
 -# it must support wxWidget's pseudo-RTTI mechanism

Child elements of @c \<object\> are handled by the custom handler and there are
no limitations on them imposed by XRC format.

This is the only mechanism that works for toplevel objects -- custom controls
are accessible using the type-unsafe wxXmlResource::LoadObject() method.



@section overview_xrcformat_packed Packed XRC Files

In addition to plain XRC files, wxXmlResource supports (if wxFileSystem support
is compiled in) compressed XRC resources. Compressed resources have either
.zip or .xrs extension and are simply ZIP files that contain arbitrary
number of XRC files and their dependencies (bitmaps, icons etc.).



@section overview_xrcformat_oldversions Older Format Versions

This section describes differences in older revisions of XRC format (i.e.
files with older values of @c version attribute of @c \<resource\>).


@subsection overview_xrcformat_pre_v2530 Versions Before 2.5.3.0

Version 2.5.3.0 introduced C-like handling of "\\" in text. In older versions,
"\n", "\t" and "\r" escape sequences were replaced with respective characters
in the same matter it's done in C, but "\\" was left intact instead of being
replaced with single "\", as one would expect. Starting with 2.5.3.0, all of
them are handled in C-like manner.


@subsection overview_xrcformat_pre_v2301 Versions Before 2.3.0.1

Prior to version 2.3.0.1, "$" was used for accelerators instead of "_"
or "&amp;". For example,
@code
<label>$File</label>
@endcode
was used in place of current version's
@code
<label>_File</label>
@endcode
(or "&amp;File").
