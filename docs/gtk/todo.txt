-------------------- High priority ---------------------

More testing of Unicode support.

Add ID based i18n system as a replacement for the

Improve, update translations. Install *.mo files somewehere.

-------------------- Medium priority ---------------------

Show accelerator control labels and actually implement them
  -> Changed in GTK 1.2 (so let's do it for 1.2). Difficult.
  
-------------------- Low priority ---------------------
    
Right aligned checkboxes: focus highlighting is wrong, tooltips can't be set can't be set

OwnerDraw for wxListCtrl and others
  -> Postponed.

Implement wxPalette
  -> I never understood that. Postponed.
 
Implement different visuals and displays
  -> I never understood that. Postponed.

Cooperation with Qt
