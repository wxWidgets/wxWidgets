-------------------- High priority ---------------------

Improve, update translations. Mostly done.

-------------------- Medium priority ---------------------

wxBitmapButton doesn't refresh when parent gets refreshed.
  -> Not important.

Show accelerator control labels and actually implement them
  -> Difficult.
  
-------------------- Low priority ---------------------
    
Right aligned checkboxes: focus highlighting is wrong, tooltips can't be set can't be set
  -> Postponed. GTK 1.4 can do that.

Add wxNoteBook::GetPageIndex()
Add wxNoteBook::SetTabPosition()
  -> Postponed.

More testing of Unicode support.
  -> Postponed.

Implement wxPalette
  -> Postponed.
 
Implement different visuals and displays
  -> I cannot test this. Postponed.

Cooperation with Qt
  -> Would be nice.
