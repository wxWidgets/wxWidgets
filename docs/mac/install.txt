Installing latest headers (and Carbon Support)
----------------------------------------------

NOTE : these steps are not necessary for Pro 6, only for Pro 5.3

the latest build for carbon support lead to a few changes you will have to follow, in order
to successfully compile the code (also necessary if you don't want to build the carbon targets)

1. you need CodeWarrior Pro 5.3 , i.e. 5.0 with all the upgrades
2. you have to download the 3.3.2 universal interfaces from 
	ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/UniversalInterfaces3.3.2.sit.hqx
3. put the Interfaces and Libraries Folder into the MacOS Support folder and replace older versions
4. remove from the MacOS Support folder the separate OpenTransport folder
5. open the file MacOS Support:MacHeaders:MacHeaders.c and add the line
		#include <ControlDefinitions.h>
	after the 
		#include <Controls.h>
6. rebuild all MacHeaders from the MacHeaders.mcp project in the same folder

if you want to build the carbon targets, you will also need the latest carbonized version of
MSL from Metrowerks, at the time of writing, this meant applying the changes from the folders
CodeWarrior Pro 5:Pre-Release:Carbon & MacOSX Development:Carbonized MSL and
CodeWarrior Pro 5:Pre-Release:Carbon & MacOSX Development:Carbonized Runtimes 
(consult the file CodeWarrior Pro 5:Pre-Release:Carbon & MacOSX Development:Carbon & MacOSX README)

setup.h
-------

in order to build wxMac with CodeWarrior, you must copy or alias the file include/wx/mac/setup0.h
to include/wx/setup.h.

this step is not needed when using the Apple Developer Tools under Mac OS X since the setup.h
file is automatically generated during the configuration of wxMac.

OpenGL
------

in order to build opengl support with CodeWarrior, you must install the opengl libraries and headers
from http://developer.apple.com/opengl/index.html

if you want OpenGL support with CodeWarrior, set wxUSE_OPENGL in include/wx/setup.h to 1

if you want OpenGL support with the Apple Developer Tools under Mac OS X, add --with-opengl to the
arguments of configure when configuring wxMac.

Project Files
-------------

there are always the makemac.mcp files for Pro 5.3 and the makemac6.mcp files for Pro 6

Problems with .xpm files
------------------------

if you have downloaded all the files and get errors like :

Error   : the file 'wx/generic/tip.xpm' cannot be opened
tipdlg.cpp line 201   #include "wx/generic/tip.xpm"

then your cvs has changed the type of the .xpm files to something other than text, in order to fix this
either change the type by using a resource editor or drag the files from /include/wx/generic/..xpm on 
the SetTypeFromExtension application that is included in this folder

Missing PLStringFuncsLib
------------------------

You will have to build All Targets for MacOS Support:Libraries:Sources:PLStringFuncs:Glue:PLStringFuncsGlue.mcp
