wxWidgets 2.8.0 for Mac installation
------------------------------------

On MacOS X, you can download Apple's free developer tools (gcc
and associated headers and libraries, such as the Carbon API).
You can then use configure in a similar way to compiling
wxWidgets on Linux (or on Windows using MinGW or Cygwin). See
'Apple Developer Tools' below for more details on using
configure.

To target on MacOS 8 or 9, you need to buy Metrowerks
CodeWarrior. You can then compile Mac Classic or MacOS X
applications on Mac OS X, or compile Mac Classic or MacOS X
applications on Mac Classic. However you can only run and debug
each type of application on the target operating system.


Apple Developer Tools: command line
-----------------------------------

As in all Unix projects, you need to do something like this under MacOS X
with the Apple Developer Tools installed:

1) cd into the base dir
2) mkdir osx-build
3) cd osx-build
4) ../configure
5) make

If you want to install the library into the system directories you'll need
to do this as root.  The accepted way of running commands as root is to
use the built-in sudo mechanism.  First of all, you must be using an
account marked as a "Computer Administrator".  Then

6) sudo make install
7) type <YOUR OWN PASSWORD>

Note that while using this method is okay for development, it is not
recommended that you require endusers to install wxWidgets into their
system directories in order to use your program.  One way to avoid this
is to configure wxWidgets with --disable-shared.  Another way to avoid
it is to make a framework for wxWidgets.  Making frameworks is beyond
the scope of this document.

Note:
We recommend you configure a static library instead:

4) ../configure --disable-shared

or activate OpenGL:

4) ../configure --with-opengl

Note:
It is rarely desirable to install non-Apple software into system directories.
By configuring the library with --disable-shared and using the full path
to wx-config with the --in-place option you can avoid installing the library.


Apple Developer Tools: XCode
----------------------------

You can use the project in src/wxWindows.xcodeproj to build wxWidgets,
and there is a sample project supplied with the minimal sample.

Creating universal binaries
---------------------------

The Xcode projects for the wxWidgets library and minimal project are set up
to create universal binaries.

If using the Apple command line tools, pass --enable-universal_binary when
configuring wxWidgets. If you use wx-config --libs to link your application,
he necessary linker flags will be added. When compiling your own files,
you need to add -arch ppc -arch i386 to your CFLAGS.

As an alternative to using --enable-universal_binary, you can build for
each architecture separately and then use the lipo tool to glue the
binaries together. Assuming building on a PPC system:

1. First build in the usual way to get the PPC library.

2. Then, build for Intel, in a different folder. This time use:

export CFLAGS="-g -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386"
export LDFLAGS="-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk"

./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no \
  --target=i386-apple-darwin8 --host=powerpc-apple-darwin8 --build=i386-apple-darwin8

You will need to reverse the powerpc and i386 parameters everywhere to build PPC on an Intel
machine.

3. Use lipo to glue the binaries together.

Building with CodeWarrior 
-------------------------

(Note that using the Apple tools is recommended.)

Installing latest headers (and Carbon Support)
----------------------------------------------

Patching headers: CodeWarrior 8.x
---------------------------------

If you run into trouble with WCHAR_MIN and WCHAR_MAX the for 
MacOS X Support:Headers:(wchar_t Support fix):machine:ansi.h,
apply the patch ansi.diff.

You may also need to comment out the _T definition in
ctype.h if you get multiple definition errors.

setup.h
-------

in order to build wxMac with CodeWarrior, you must copy or alias the file
include/wx/mac/setup0.h to include/wx/setup.h.

this step is not needed when using the Apple Developer Tools under Mac OS X
since the setup.h file is automatically generated during the configuration.

OpenGL
------

In order to build opengl support with CodeWarrior, you must install the opengl
libraries and headers from http://developer.apple.com/opengl/index.html

If you want OpenGL support with CodeWarrior, set wxUSE_OPENGL to 1 in
include/wx/setup.h

If you don't want OpenGl support, set wxUSE_OPENGL to 0 (the
default) and remove the file OpenGLLibraryStub from the project
before compilation.

If you want OpenGL support with the Apple Developer Tools under Mac OS X, add
--with-opengl to the arguments of configure when configuring wxMac.

Project Files
-------------

The project files are stored as xml text files and converted to binary
CodeWarrior projects in the distribution (see AppleScript Files below):

  - *M8.xml -> *M8.mcp for CodeWarrior 8 and above.

AppleScript Files
-----------------

Several AppleScript files are provided in the docs:mac directory:

  - M8xml2mcp.applescript to convert xml files to CodeWarrior 8 projects
  - M8mcp2xml.applescript to convert CodeWarrior 8 projects to xml files
  - SetXMLCreator.applescript to set correct creator type (see below)

To run the XML to MCP conversion scripts:

Double click on e.g. docs/mac/M8xml2mcp.applescript, then "run"
the applescript and when asked for a folder pick src/. Then it
takes a while to scan all dirs for the xml files and convert
them to mcps. If some conversions fail it means an mcp already
exists (back them up prior to running the script).

To set the correct creator type for importing into CodeWarrior,
you may need to run SetXMLCreator.applescript.

Problems with .xpm files
------------------------

if you have downloaded all the files and get errors like :

Error   : the file 'wx/generic/tip.xpm' cannot be opened
tipdlg.cpp line 201   #include "wx/generic/tip.xpm"

then your cvs has changed the type of the .xpm files to something other than
text, in order to fix this either change the type by using a resource editor
or drag the files from /include/wx/generic/..xpm on the SetTypeFromExtension
application that is included in this folder. This small applet itself queries
the Internet Config, so you will have to associate the "xpm" extension with
CodeWarrior before making use of this applet.

Missing PLStringFuncsLib
------------------------

You will have to build All Targets for MacOS Support:Libraries:Sources:PLStringFuncs:Glue:PLStringFuncsGlue.mcp
