Suggested slogans from wx-users:

wxWidgets: The API for programmers who aren't sheep.
(Robin Dunn)

Better printed on a shirt:

"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
 butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
 balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying,
 take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations,
 analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a
 tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.
 Specialization is for insects."
                                               [Robert A. Heinlein]

maybe stripped down to

"Specialization is for insects."

============================
The Open-Source, Cross-Platform GUI Framework
  with Ten Years of Evolution Behind It

I saw this changed to 'native UI' on the website, which is slightly more
accurate but sounds less 'catchy' imho.

.. and templates.

Hmm. I might buy a mug that had, say, a wxLogo and "wxWidgets" (and
maybe the website URL underneath in smaller type) on one side and
"Specialization is for insects ... and templates" on the other.

.. only if it held at least a full half (imperial) pint, mind. Not
one of those wussy 8.5 fl.oz. jobbies.

That'd be a nice ice-breaker when working at a new client's site -
people would be bound to stop and ask what it was all about!

.. and how about a nice silk tie (US: necktie) with the logo on ...
Oh, I forgot, we programmers don't wear ties.

============================
"I can't believe it's not native"

============================
"Because friends don't let friends use Win32".

(or MFC)

============================

Have a photo of 3 babes wearing Linux, Windows and Mac Logo T-shirt with
words at the bottom.

"Why choose one when you can have 3?"

wxWidgets: Write it once and for all.

At front:

    Need an API?
      <wxWidgets>
   and get THE API

       C++, Python, Basic, Lua ...

At back

    <windows> OR <linux> OR <mac> ?
                <wxWidgets>  is
    <windows> AND <linux> AND <mac>

where <xxxxx> is the respective logo

wxWidgets

How about "and in the linker bind them"? That's where the local libraries
get bound to the wxWidgets code anyway.

Nice idea. But I wonder where you'll find some volunteer willing to
have his face tattooed with win32 common controls ;-)
