March 8, 2018 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a
major new release of our open source framework for the development
of native cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.0.4 is a stable bug fix release in 3.0 branch and is
available at

	https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.0.4/

Please choose the archive format suitable for your platform, i.e. 7z
or ZIP for Windows platforms and tar.bz2 for the Unix systems
including OS X (all archives contain sources for all wxWidgets ports
but they use different line endings) and follow the instructions in
readme.txt file for installing it. Notice that if you decide to use
the Windows installer (.exe file) you still need to build wxWidgets
as only sources, not binaries, are installed.

We also provide the pre-built versions of wxMSW libraries for the
selected compilers.


This is a bug fix release with no significant new features compared to
the previous 3.0.x releases and compatible with them at both the API
and the ABI level (i.e. all applications linked against earlier 3.0.x
DLLs or shared libraries will continue to work when using 3.0.4
libraries).

The full list of changes in this release is available at

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.0.4/docs/changes.txt

(starting from the line 583, or search for "3.0.4" in this file), here are
some selected ones:

* In all ports:
 - Fix various problems when parsing invalid ZIP files.
 - Update selection in wxAuiNotebook correctly after tab move.

* In wxGTK:
 - Allow using more recent WebKit2GTK+ in wxWebView (Scott Talbert).
 - Fix keyboard navigation for controls which are initially disabled.

* In wxMSW:
 - Fix BSTR memory leaks in wxMediaCtrl and wxWebView (PB).

* In wxOSX:
 - Fix build with 10.13 (High Sierra) SDK (Fran√ßois-Xavier Coudert).
 - Fix removing tools from wxToolBar.
 - Fix crash when switching between monitors.


If you are upgrading from wxWidgets 2.8 or earlier, please read the
"INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES" section in the beginning of this file and the
corresponding part of the manual at

    http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0.4/overview_changes_since28.html



We recommend that you upgrade to wxWidgets 3.0.4 if you already use an
earlier wxWidgets 3.0.x release, the upgrade is completely transparent
and doesn't require any changes in the existing code. If you are still
using wxWidgets 2.8 or earlier, please consider updating to wxWidgets
3.0 to profit from all the new functionality.


We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
