April 27, 2020 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a
major new release of our open source framework for the development
of native cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.0.5 is a stable bug fix release in 3.0 branch and is
available at

	https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.0.5/

Please choose the archive format suitable for your platform, i.e. 7z
or ZIP for Windows platforms and tar.bz2 for the Unix systems
including OS X (all archives contain sources for all wxWidgets ports
but they use different line endings) and follow the instructions in
readme.txt file for installing it. Notice that if you decide to use
the Windows installer (.exe file) you still need to build wxWidgets
as only sources, not binaries, are installed.

We also provide the pre-built versions of wxMSW libraries for the
selected compilers.


This is a bug fix release with no significant new features compared to
the previous 3.0.x releases and compatible with them at both the API
and the ABI level (i.e. all applications linked against earlier 3.0.x
DLLs or shared libraries will continue to work when using 3.0.5
libraries).

The full list of changes in this release is available at

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.0.5/docs/changes.txt

(starting from the line 583, or search for "3.0.5" in this file), here are
some selected ones:

* In all ports:
- Support nullptr in wxPrintf() and other pseudo-vararg functions.
- Fix problem with wx-config installation and use under NetBSD (wiz).
- Avoid spurious errors on thread creation under NetBSD.
- Improve stock items consistency and aesthetics (dhowland).
- Implement wxTextCtrl::HitTest() for single line controls.
- Improve wxSVGFileDC to support more of wxDC API (Maarten Bent).

* In wxGTK:
- Fix position of popup menus shown in wxListCtrl.
- Fix not showing wxInfoBar with GTK+ 3 < 3.22.29.
- Potentially incompatible change: wxDataViewModel::Cleared() now works as
  documented cross-platform.  Previously on wxGTK it just emptied the model
  rather than triggering a reload of the model.  If you are working around the
  broken behaviour with wxGTK-specific code in your application you should
  check that your application works correctly with this change.
- Return appropriate values for some previously hard-coded system colours.

* In wxMSW:
- Fix handling of AUX2 mouse button events (Trylz).
- Honour alignment flags for multiline buttons using custom colours too.
- Fix crash when using wxCHMHelpController() in 64 bit builds (Xlord2).


If you are upgrading from wxWidgets 2.8 or earlier, please read the
"INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES" section in the beginning of this file and the
corresponding part of the manual at

    http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0.5/overview_changes_since28.html



We recommend that you upgrade to wxWidgets 3.0.5 if you already use an
earlier wxWidgets 3.0.x release, the upgrade is completely transparent
and doesn't require any changes in the existing code. If you are still
using wxWidgets 2.8 or earlier, please consider updating to wxWidgets
3.0 to profit from all the new functionality.


We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
