December 12, 2015 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.9 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.9


This release doesn't add any major new features, but contains some important
fixes for bugs found in the previous 3.2.8 release:

- Fix crash when using Farsi as system language under macOS (#25561).
- Fix handling total window size with GNOME with X11 (#25348).
- Fix memory leak when using wxOverlay (#24500).
- Fix wxGLCanvas scale when using EGL/Wayland in high DPI (Popax21, #23733).
- Fix missing wxEVT_CHAR for Ctrl-Letter in non-US layouts (#25384).
- Fix selecting columns in wxGrid with mouse (Dietmar Schwertberger, #25884).

The new release still contains a couple of enhancements, including:

- Many improvements to CMake build system (#25448, #25749, #25998).
- Support for building under macOS 26 Tahoe (#25798).
- Fix wxStyledTextCtrl support in screen readers (Maarten Bent, #25963).
- Respect HTML5 charset attribute in wxHTML (Kees van der Oord, #25546).
- Add support for using EGL 1.4 (and not 1.5) in wxGLCanvas (#22325).

Other changes include:

- Fix memory leak in wxColour::Set() under macOS (#25569).
- Fix memory leak when using wxOverlay in wxGTK (#24500).
- Reduce wxStaticBitmap GDI resource usage in wxMSW (Alex Shvartzkop, #25698).
- Significantly improve performance of drawing bitmaps in wxAUI (#23841).

Please see the full change log for more details:

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, meaning that
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
