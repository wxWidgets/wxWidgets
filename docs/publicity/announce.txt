December 10, 2018 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.1.2 is the latest release in the 3.1 development
branch and is now available at

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.1.2

Compared to the stable 3.0.x series, this version brings many
improvements and even more bug fixes, please see the change log

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.1.2/docs/changes.txt

for the incomplete list of the most important ones. Here is the
maximally condensed summary of the changes compared to 3.0:

- Build system improvements: support for new compilers (MSVS 2017, g++ 8) and
  OS versions (macOS 10.14 and its dark mode) as well as an entirely new CMake
  build system.
- New features: support for mouse gesture events (GSoC 2017 project);
  non-integer font sizes and arbitrary font weights in wxFont; fractional pen
  widths in wxGraphicsContext; arbitrary label windows in wxStaticBox; markup
  in wxDataViewCtrl items text; better support for high DPI monitors; support
  for ZIP 64 files; LZMA compression; much improved accessibility support under
  MSW.
- New classes: wxActivityIndicator, wxAddRemoveCtrl,
  wxAppProgressIndicator, wxNativeWindow, wxPowerResourceBlocker,
  wxSecretStore.
- And methods: wxDataViewToggleRenderer::ShowAsRadio(), wxDateTime::
  GetWeekBasedYear(), wxDisplay::GetPPI(), wxGrid::SetCornerLabelValue(),
  wxHtmlEasyPrinting::SetPromptMode(), wxJoystickEvent::GetButtonOrdinal(),
  wxListBox::GetTopItem(), wxProcess::Activate(), wxTextEntry::ForceUpper(),
  several ones in wxRendererNative, wxStandardPaths::GetUserDir(),
  wxToolbook::EnablePage(), wxUIActionSimulator::Select() and many others.
- Significant improvements to: wxBusyInfo, wxDataViewCtrl,
  wxNotificationMessage, wxStaticBox, wxStyledTextCtrl.
- Latest versions of all bundled 3rd party libraries, including all the
  security fixed and support for WebKit 2 and GStreamer 1.7 under Unix.
- Revamped OpenGL support better suited to modern OpenGL (3.2+).
- Further C++11 support improvements.
- A lot of bug fixes, especially in wxGTK3 and wxOSX/Cocoa ports.
- New experimental wxQt port.


This release is a "development" one as it makes (very few)
incompatible API changes compared to 3.0 and does not guarantee the
ABI stability, unlike the 3.0.x series. It is not inherently more
buggy or less stable than the "stable" releases and you're encouraged
to use it, including in production. If you're already using 3.0, upgrading
shouldn't require any special effort, so please try it out.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
