July 21, 2025 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce the first new
development release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.3.1 is the second release in the 3.3.x development series coming
soon after 3.3.0 and is mostly a bug fix release, correcting some regressions
found in 3.3.0. The new version is available now from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.3.1

The most important fixes since 3.3.0 include:

- Restore Windows date/time pickers behaviour under non-English OS (#25511).
- Fix crash on startup under macOS when using Farsi as system language (#25561).
- Fix losing wxGenericListCtrl contents after AppendColumn() (#25519).
- Fix crash when sorting wxDataViewCtrl in wxGTK in some circumstances (#25625).
- Fix crash when using per-window menu in Windows MDI applications (#25522).
- Restore inadvertently broken API compatibility in wxPropertyGrid (#25627).

There were also a number of fixes to the new Windows dark mode support:

- Fix crash with wxStaticBitmap inside wxNotebook in dark mode (#25499).
- Fix disabled wxButton bitmaps appearance in dark mode (#25575).
- Fix disabled wxStaticText appearance in dark mode (#25574).
- Fix notebook background in dark high contrast themes (#25542).
- Fix regression in wxDataViewCtrl border in light mode (#25532).
- Fix selected toolbar buttons in dark mode (Stefan Ziegler, #25616).
- Fix wxComboCtrl appearance in dark mode (#23766).
- Fix wxTE_RICH wxTextCtrl appearance in dark mode (#25602).

And, finally, this release also contains a small number of new features:

- Allow setting "app id" under supported platforms (Windows/Wayland) (#25548).
- Add persistence support for wxRadioButtons (#25530) and wxCheckBox (#25515).
- Add support for PNG "Description" text chunk to wxImage (#25556).
- wxNumberFormatter improvements (#25614, #25635).

Please see the change log

for the list of the other important changes.


This release is part of the "development" release series, but these development
releases are suitable for production use: the only difference between them and
"stable" releases is that neither ABI nor API stability is guaranteed in 3.3.x.
However we strive to minimize API-incompatible changes even so and, in spite of
a huge number of changes since the last stable version, this release remains
almost fully API-compatible with wxWidgets 3.2 and updating the existing
applications to use it should be straightforward. However please make sure to
read the "INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES" section in the change log to be aware of the
breaking changes in it.


We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
