Welcome to wxWidgets, a free and open source cross-platform C++ framework for writing advanced GUI applications using native controls.

wxWidgets 3.3.0 is the first release in the 3.3 development branch, bringing many new features and improvements compared to the stable 3.2 branch while remaining mostly API-compatible with it.

Please note that even this is not a "stable" release, it is still considered to be suitable to be used in production, the only difference with the stable releases is that API and ABI compatibility are not guaranteed for the releases in this series. In practice, however, backwards-incompatible API changes are expected to be rare.

Please see [**README**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.3.0/docs/readme.txt) for more information about this release and the [change log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.3.0/docs/changes.txt) for more details of the changes in it. In particular, please read the "INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES" section in the change log if you are upgrading from a previous version of wxWidgets.


## Source Files and Documentation

If you intend to build wxWidgets from sources (which is recommended), please do **NOT** download the files using the "Source code" links just above, which are automatically generated by GitHub and don't contain the submodules sources which are necessary for building wxWidgets.

Instead, download one of [wxWidgets-3.3.0.zip](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.3.0/wxWidgets-3.3.0.zip) or [wxWidgets-3.3.0.7z](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.3.0/wxWidgets-3.3.0.7z), for much smaller size, for Microsoft Windows systems or [wxWidgets-3.3.0.tar.bz2](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.3.0/wxWidgets-3.3.0.tar.bz2) for Unix ones, including macOS. These archives have exactly the same contents, but use the line endings appropriate for the corresponding platform.

In addition, we provide archives containing the documentation in either HTML or Microsoft CHM formats. Notice that the documentation is also [available online](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.3.0).

Finally, Microsoft Windows users may download [Setup.exe file](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.3.0/wxMSW-3.3.0-Setup.exe) containing both sources and documentation, however please note that this file does _not_ contain any binaries, please see below for those.

To verify your download please use the following SHA-1 checksums:

## Binaries

We provide pre-built binary files for x86-64 Windows for the following compilers:

* Microsoft Visual C++ compiler versions 14.0, 14.1, 14.2 and 14.3 (corresponding to marketing product names of Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022 respectively). Please note that MSVC 14.x versions are ABI-compatible and the same set of binaries is used for all of them.
* gcc 15.1 provided by [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) MINGW64 environment.

### For Developers

For developing applications with wxWidgets you need to download the compiler-independent `wxWidgets-3.3.0_Headers.7z` file and one of `wxMSW-3.3.0-vc14x_x64_Dev.7z` or `wxMSW-3.3.0_gcc1510_x64_Dev.7z` files depending on your compiler.

Unpack both files into the same directory so that `include` and `lib` directories are at the same level after unpacking. You should be able to compile and link applications using wxWidgets in both debug and release modes but the debug symbols are provided only for debug libraries in this archive, see below for the release build debug symbols.

Note that if you're setting up a new project using these binaries, the simplest way to do it is to use the provided `wxwidgets.props` file: for this, open the `View|Property Manager` menu item in the IDE, select "Add Existing Property Sheet..." from the project context menu and browse to this file in the file open dialog.

Please see the [instructions in the manual](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.3.0/plat_msw_binaries.html) for more details.

### For End Users

End users may download one of `wxMSW-3.3.0_vc14x_x64_ReleaseDLL.7z` or `wxMSW-3.3.0_gcc1510_x64_ReleaseDLL.7z` files to get just the DLLs required for running the applications using wxWidgets.

### For Debugging

* Microsoft Visual C++ users: File `wxMSW-3.3.0_vc14x_x64_ReleasePDB.7z` contains the debug symbols for the release build of the DLLs. Download it if you want to debug your own applications in release build or if you want to get meaningful information from mini-dumps retrieved from your users machines.
* gcc users: Currently the debug symbols are not available for the release build of the DLLs (only the debug versions of the DLLs contain the debug symbols).
