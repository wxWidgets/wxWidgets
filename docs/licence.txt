wxWindows Licence
-----------------

Copyright (c) 1998 Julian Smart, Markus Holzem


Preamble
--------

This licence is intended to protect wxWindows, its developers,
and its users, so that the considerable investment it represents
is not abused.

Unlike the L-GPL licence, you as a user are not obliged to
distribute wxWindows source code with your products. However,
you are prevented from selling the code without permission from
the authors, or denying others the rights to use or distribute
wxWindows in the way intended.

The wxWindows Licence establishes the copyright for the code and
related material, and it gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library. It also asserts that no
warranty is given by the authors for this or derived code.

Finally, the licence specifies that any patent involving
wxWindows, must be licenced for everyone's free use.

wxWindows Licence
-----------------

Terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

1. This Licence Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this wxWindows Licence (also called "this Licence").  Each
licencee is addressed as "you". 

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or
work which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus
any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this Licence; they are outside its scope. The act
of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
output from such a program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true
depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
the Library does.
  
2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this Licence and to the
absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this Licence
along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.

3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
of Section 1 above, provided that you cause the files modified
to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
and the date of any change. With agreement from the authors of
wxWindows, you may charge for value added to the Library, for
example, a commercially supported version, or a port to a new
platform. It is expected that collaboration between such
commercial interests and the free wxWindows community will yield
benefits to both parties, since wxWindows represents a
substantial investment of time and effort. It is not in the
spirit of this agreement that commercial exploitation of
wxWindows should in any way detract from the free version.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library in object code or
derived library form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
copy the source code from the same place satisfies the
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

5. You may not copy, modify, sublicence, link with, or
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
Licence.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicence,
link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this Licence.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
under this Licence will not have their licences terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

6. You are not required to accept this Licence, since you have
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this Licence.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
Licence to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

7. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on
the Library), the recipient automatically receives a licence
from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or
modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties to this Licence.

8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this Licence, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
Licence. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this Licence and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent licence
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this Licence
would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to
apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system which is implemented by public licence practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on
consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licencee cannot impose
that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this Licence.

9. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted
in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library
under this Licence may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this Licence incorporates the limitation as if written in
the body of this Licence.

10. The authors of wxWindows may publish revised and/or new
versions of the wxWindows Licence from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library specifies a version number of this Licence which applies
to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the wxWindows authors.  If the Library does
not specify a licence version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the wxWindows authors.

11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other
free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible
with these, write to the program author to ask for permission.
For software which is copyrighted by the wxWindows authors,
write to the wxWindows authors.  Our decision will be guided by
the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY
-----------

12. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENCED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO
IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH
ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
