wxWindows Buglist

wxGTK:

wxMSW:

wxMotif:
--------

- If a popup wxMenu is destroyed after its parent window has been
  destroyed, we get the message "Object XXX does not have windowed
  ancestor".
  Workaround: delete the menu before deleting the window on which it
  was popped up.
  Possible fix: call menu->DestroyMenu() before deleting the window,
  if the window knows about the menu that was last popped up (hard
  to know this with confidence).

- In wxGrid, cell highlight is not drawn/erased properly.

- Setting the size of a hidden window may show that window.

- Motif-specific wxImage functions not yet implemented.

General:
