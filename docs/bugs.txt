BUG NUMBER:             1
SHORT DESCRIPTION:      Popup menu bug
DETAILS:
If a popup wxMenu is destroyed after its parent window has been
destroyed, we get the message "Object XXX does not have windowed
ancestor".
Possible fix: call menu->DestroyMenu() before deleting the window,
if the window knows about the menu that was last popped up (hard
to know this with confidence).
WORKAROUND:
Delete the menu before deleting the window on which it
was popped up.

BUG NUMBER:             2
SHORT DESCRIPTION:      Misc. Motif bugs
DETAILS:
- In wxGrid, cell highlight is not drawn/erased properly.

- Setting the size of a hidden window may show that window.

- wxRadioBox sometimes doesn't show (e.g. in controls sample).

- Can't set the colours for the buttons in the file selector, for
  some reason.

- On SGI IRIX 6.4, XtDestroyWidget in ~wxWindow causes a crash in
  some cicumstances. This is being looked into. Meanwhile, a
  possible workaround is to remove the final XtDestroyWidget line in ~wxWindow
  (window.cpp). This will mean that child windows will only get
  destroyed when frames and dialogs are destroyed, so dynamic subwindow
  deletion may not work properly.

- There are reports that scrolling can cause crashes under Lesstif.
  This is probably a Lesstif bug.

SHORT DESCRIPTION:      Dialog Editor issues
DETAILS:
Dialog Editor could be more user-friendly. Controls are hard to
size and position accurately. No way of changing tab order
except by editing .wxr file.

SHORT DESCRIPTION: Appending a menuitem with negative id causes menu not to be shown
DETAILS: I haven't tested it throughly, though it happens when appending a submenu
WORKAROUND: Add dummy id number even for menuitems which don't require them (submenus for example)

BUG NUMBER:             5
SHORT DESCRIPTION: no vertical space inside wxHTML
DETAILS: We are working on making a demonstration of projects we do here
using Python & wxWindows & HTML (wxPython/wxHTML thus). We 'd like to
have the opportunity to specify vertical space, eg <br><br>, or <p><p>
in HTML. These constructs currently do not work. I looked in the source
code (nice job btw), but am not sure where to hack the solution. I
am willing to discuss this in more detail. 
WORKAROUND: Create a transparent gif of 1x1 pixel and use width & height
to fool the renderer

SHORT+DESCRIPTION: misnamed setup.wXX files prevents install
Submit: Submit
WORKAROUND: The problem seems to be that the default download name for the setup.wXX files is not 'setup.wXX' but instead 'setup.wXX..wXX'  Every new user who installs could change these names... but why not simply change them on the server?  (I was using IE 5 under Windows 98)

DATE+IDENTIFIED: 26/11/1999
DETAILS: Around line 1234 or the common/docview.cpp file following code exists...

if (!theTemplate)
    theTemplate=templates[FilterIndex] ;

The problem is tat FilterIndex is one based and the templates array is zero based. The correct
thing might be to use FilterIndex-1 as the index. Else the following scenario will
cause a crash.

1. Use the docvsmdi example
2. Bring up the file open dlg.
3. Select Files of Type "Text"
4. c:\autoexec.bat for file name
5. Press okay and you should see
   the crash.

I understand that it is very
hard to figure out the template
when the user does not select
one of the known extensions but
this simple fix might atleast
avoid the crash....

I started playing with wxMSW
just this morning and have not
yet figured out exactly how to
submit a fix. I atleast wanted
to report it. Besides what I do
for the MSW might not be correct
for the other platforms :-)

Note from JACS: fixed (I hope) by making m_filterIndex
zero-based in MSW wxFileDialog implementation
(it's zero-based in wxGTK/the generic dialog).

DETAILS: wxGTK cannot seem to find the default font
on (some?) Debian 2.x systems.  This results
in infinite recursion in wxLoadQueryNearestFont.

It only happens on one of my two Debian machines,
but I haven't investigated thoroughly enough to give
any more detail.

I have made a temporary workaround by trapping
recursion in wxLoadQueryNearestFont with a static
bool flag.

I will investigate the problem further if this bug has
not already been reported by someone else.

The reason is the wxGetDefaultDeviceName
function in file msw/dcprint.cpp. In line 253
the memory is freed, and then
the pointer to the freed memory
is used.

DETAILS: I tested wxWindows/GTK+ with a simple example which
uses frame, menu, and statusbar. But when I selected
a menu item which creates a simple 'about dialog'
several times, the program crashed with segmentation fault.
I traced it with gdb, and I got this message:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
0x408f1796 in match_theme_image ()
  from /usr/lib/gtk/themes/engines/libpixmap.so

I guessed from this message that the pixmap routine in
GTK+ theme engine caused crash. So, I changed GTK+ theme
to default which doesn't use any pixmaps and tested
again. This time, the program didn't crash.

I'm using Redhat 6.1 with egcs 1.1.2.
