wxWidgets for MGL installation
------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE:

  wxMGL is currently in need of some work to bring it up to the
  standard of some of the other wxWidgets ports.

  If you experience problems installing, please re-read these
  instructions and other related files (todo.txt, bugs.txt and
  osname.txt for your platform if it exists) carefully before
  mailing wxwin-users or the author. Preferably, try to fix the
  problem first and then send a patch to the author.

  When sending bug reports tell us what version of wxWidgets you are
  using (including the beta) and what compiler on what system. One
  example: wxMGL 2.7.0, gcc 2.95.3, Redhat 7.0

First steps
-----------

- Download SciTech MGL library from http://www.scitechsoft.com. The
  downloads page is here (you need MGL version 5.0beta7 or newer):
  http://scitechsoft.com/products/dev/mgl_download/mgl_down.html

  Install MGL according to provided instructions. In particular, make sure that
  MGL_ROOT and NUCLEUS_PATH environment variables are set before attempting to
  build wxMGL.

  Make sure you installed all MGL components, including the "fonts" package
  (it's called mgl_<ver>-font.tar.gz in Linux version). It is important to have
  SciTech's basic fonts in $(MGL_ROOT)/fonts directory (you may want to add
  Arial TrueType font for better output quality) and basic cursors in
  $(MGL_ROOT)/cursors. wxMGL depends on their presence.

- Download wxMGL-x.y.z.tgz, where x.y.z is the version number.
  Download documentation in a preferred format, such as
  wxWidgets-HTML.zip or wxWidgets-PDF.zip.

- Make a directory such as ~/wx and unarchive the files into this
  directory.

- You can now use configure or makefiles to build wxWidgets and the samples.
  In case of problems, please use GNU make.


COMPILING
=========

Following systems are supported by wxMGL so far:
 - Unix (Linux etc.)
 - MS-DOS (DJGPP and Watcom compilers)


* Compiling using configure
----------------------------

These instructions apply to installation on a Unix system (such as Linux). Please
see below for information on using configure on non-Unix platforms.

If you compile wxWidgets on Linux for the first time and don't like to read
install instructions just do (in the base dir):

> ./configure --with-mgl
> make
> su <type root password>
> make install
> ldconfig
> exit

Afterwards you can continue with

> make
> su <type root password>
> make install
> ldconfig
> exit

If you want to remove wxWidgets on Unix you can do this:

> su <type root password>
> make uninstall
> ldconfig
> exit

You can set many options to configure. Type

> ./configure --help

and you will get a list of supported options.


* Using wxMGL library built with configure
-------------------------------------------

'make install' will install wx-config script that can (and should) be used
to get compiler flags that are needed to build your program. wx-config --cxxflags
will output necessary C++ compiler flags and wx-config --libs will list all
needed libraries. See an example of wxWidgets application makefile:

minimal: minimal.o
	$(CC) -o minimal minimal.o `wx-config --libs`

minimal.o: minimal.cpp mondrian.xpm
	$(CC) `wx-config --cxxflags` -c minimal.cpp -o minimal.o


* Using configure to build MS-DOS version
------------------------------------------

Even though configure is a Unix script, you can use it to build MS-DOS version
of the wxMGL library. There are two possible ways to achieve this: you can
either cross-compile from Unix or compile natively. Either way you will needed
the DJGPP port of GCC compiler freely available from:
    http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html

Scitech MGL must be compiled natively, and to do this you will need to download
the following files (from the current/v2 and current/v2gnu directories). You
should get the latest versions available rather than the exact versions shown
below, they are just an example of what to look for:

djdev203.zip B   1,530,778 020811 DJGPP development kit 2.03
bnu2161b.zip B   3,483,132 050708 GNU Binutils 2.16.1 for DJGPP V2
gcc344b.zip  B   3,772,211 050527 GNU GCC 3.4.4 for DJGPP V2
gpp344b.zip  B   4,026,725 050527 GNU C++ Compiler 3.4.4 for DJGPP V2

If you want to build wxMGL natively using the DJGPP compiler, you will have to
install a couple of Unix utilities. I think the following is the minimum that
will work:

bsh204b.zip  B     454,308 020106 GNU Bash shell 2.04 for DJGPP V2
fil41b.zip   B   1,738,170 030830 GNU fileutils 4.1 for DJGPP V2
find41b.zip  B     306,826 010505 GNU findutils 4.1 for DJGPP V2
grep24b.zip  B     254,997 000116 GNU Grep 2.4 for DJGPP V2
mak3791b.zip B     272,798 020106 GNU Make 3.79.1 for DJGPP V2
sed414b.zip  B     159,920 050331 GNU Sed 4.1.4 for DJGPP V2
shl2011b.zip B   1,195,021 020419 GNU sh-utils 2.01 for DJGPP V2

You'll probably also want a debugger:
gdb611b.zip  B   1,585,648 040629 GNU GDB Debugger 6.1.1 for DJGPP V2

And maybe some of these:
faq230b.zip  B     679,865 000203 FAQ 2.30 for DJGPP v2.03
dif281b.zip  B     402,859 040911 GNU Diffutils 2.8.1 for DJGPP V2
gwk314b.zip  B     968,667 050321 GNU Awk 3.1.4 for DJGPP V2
gzip135b.zip B     146,138 041215 GNU gzip 1.3.5 for DJGPP V2
lss374b.zip  B     199,805 020405 GNU Less 374 for DJGPP V2
pat254b.zip  B     114,250 040326 GNU Patch 2.5.4 for DJGPP V2
tar112ab.zip B     236,427 000305 GNU Tar 1.12a for DJGPP V2
whic211b.zip B      86,296 000911 GNU which 2.11 for DJGPP V2

The system you compile on must support long file names. You can use Windows 9x
or an x86 version of Windows 2000/XP or later. For example:

C:\>set MGL_ROOT=c:/scitech
C:\>set DJGPP=c:/djgpp/djgpp.env
C:\>PATH=c:\djgpp\bin
C:\>set PS1=\w\$
C:\>bash
c:/$ mkdir build
c:/$ cd build
c:/build$ ../wxWidgets/configure
c:/build$ make
c:/build$ cd samples/minimal
c:/build/samples/minimal$ make

Cross-compilation is very easy. It works like ordinary compilation with
configure, you only have to specify the target:

> ./configure --with-mgl --build=i586-linux --host=i586-pc-msdosdjgpp
> make

For this to work, you must have installed a cross compiler on your system.

Linux rpms are available here:
    http://ap1.pp.fi/djgpp/gcc/cross-compiler/index.html

NetBSD has a binary package which can be installed with:
    # pkg_add cross-i386-msdosdjgpp

For other systems you will need to obtain the djgpp sources and compile them
yourself.


* Building wxMGL for MS-DOS using Watcom C/C++
-----------------------------------------------

<Note: this section is currently out of date>

You will need Watcom C/C++ compiler version 11 or newer (Watcom is going to be
OpenSourced by SciTech, check out http://www.openwatcom.org).

1. Edit $(WXDIR)\include\wx\univ\setup.h to suit your needs (in same way as you
   do when compiling wxMSW).

2. Go to $(WXDIR)\src\mgl and run
   > wmake -f makefile.wat all

3. You can compile the samples by typing 'wmake -f makefile.mgl all' in sample
   directory if this file is available. If it is not, copy makefile.wat to
   makefile.mgl and replace the line that says

       !include $(WXDIR)\src\makeprog.wat

   with

       !include $(WXDIR)\src\mgl\makeprog.wat


Compilation notes for MGL with gcc
----------------------------------

The mvis library doesn't compile with current versions of gcc. However wxMGL
does not use this part of MGL, so it can be taken out of the compile, e.g.:
