# Making a New wxWidgets Release

Creating a new release requires a few things before getting started:

* Linux (or another Unix but GNU tar is required).
* Windows 7+ with HTML Help Workshop, and Inno Setup installed.
* 7-Zip, Doxygen 1.8.8, and GraphViz installed on both machines.
* [Bakefile 0.2.12](https://bakefile.org/) installed on the linux machine.

Unless mentioned otherwise, all steps should be run on Linux or OSX so that the
repository export used for the release is primarily using LF line endings. Files
that require CRLF line endings will be converted appropriately.

*Important:* Ensure that 7-Zip, HTML Help Workshop, Doxygen, GraphViz and Inno
Setup have all been added to your Path in Windows. You can confirm this by
running `7z`, `hhc`, `iscc`, `doxygen -v`, and `dot -V` in a command prompt.
Add the missing installed folder locations of any executables to your Path.

## Checking ABI Compatibility

For the stable (even) releases only, check that binary compatibility hasn't
been broken since the last stable release.

### Checking under Unix systems using `abi-compliance-checker` tool.

Instructions:

1. Get [the tool](https://lvc.github.io/abi-compliance-checker/).
1. Build the old (vX.Y.Z-1) library with `-g -Og` options, i.e. configure it
   with `--enable-debug` and `CXXFLAGS=-Og CFLAFS=-Og`. For convenience, let's
   assume it's built in "$old" subdirectory.
1. Build the new (vX.Y.Z) library with the same options in "$new".
1. Create directories for temporary files containing the ABI dumps for the old
   and new libraries: `mkdir -p ../compat/{$old,$new}`.
1. Run abi-dumper on all libraries: `for l in $old/lib/*.so; do abi-dumper $l
   -lver $old -o ../compat/$old/$(basename $l).dump; done` and the same thing with
   the new libraries.
1. Run abi-compliance-checker on each pair of produced dumps to generate HTML
   reports: `for l in 3.0.2/*dump; do abi-compliance-checker -l $(basename $l
   .dump) -old $l -new 3.0.3/$(basename $l); done`.
1. Examine these reports, paying attention to the problem summary.

### Checking under MSW systems.

Manually check compatibility by building the widgets samples from the old tree
and then run it using the new DLLs.

## Pre-Release Steps

Perform the following steps. You can run `build/tools/pre-release.sh` to do
the straightforward changes like updating the dates and checksums
automatically, but please also review and update the contents of the README
and announcement text.

The Post-Release step of the previous release will have updated
the micro version of this release. If this release represents a major
or minor release, these changes will have to be performed manually at
this point.

Note that the best order depends on the release being prepared: for a
development release, `docs/publicity/announce.txt` contains the list of the
major changes since the last stable release and should be updated first, as
this part of it can then be copied verbatim to the corresponding section of
the README file. For the stable releases, it's probably more convenient to
update the README with the details of the changes first.

Here is the list of the files, for reference:
* Update `docs/readme.txt`: version needs to be changed, content updated.
* Update `docs/release.md`: also version and reset SHA-1 sums to zeroes.
* Update `docs/changes.txt`: put the date on the release line and copy the
  actual changes from Git notes as instructed in the file.
* Update the date in the manual (`docs/doxygen/mainpages/manual.h`).
* Update the release announcement post in `docs/publicity/announce.txt`.
* Update `docs/msw/binaries.md`: at least the version, but possibly also
  the list of supported compilers.

Commit the changes and tag the release using your GPG key:

    git tag -s -m 'Tag X.Y.Z release' vX.Y.Z

   Don't overwrite existing tags. For non-final releases use e.g. `X.Y.Z-rc1`
   instead of `X.Y.Z`.

## Creating Release Files

The release scripts can be run from any working directory, and they will
generate all release package files under `distrib/release/x.y.z`. The scripts
mostly build the release packages based on the current HEAD commit, so always
ensure you have the appropriate tag or commit checked out.

1. Run `./build/tools/release.sh x.y.z` to create source archives
   `wxWidgets-x.y.z.{7z,tar.bz2,zip}`, `wxWidgets-x.y.z-headers.7z`, and
   `wxWidgets-x.y.z-docs-html.{tar.bz2,zip}` packages.

2. Copy just the `wxWidgets-x.y.z.zip` package into the same
   `distrib\release\x.y.z` folder on Windows.

3. Run `build/tools/release.bat x.y.z` in a Windows command prompt. To avoid
   confusion note that, unlike other generated files, the Windows installer is
   created based on files as well as instructions (`build/tools/wxwidgets.iss`)
   contained in the copied release ZIP and not from the current working wx
   directory.

4. Copy `wxMSW-x.y.z-Setup.exe` back to your Linux or OSX `distrib/release/x.y.z`
   directory so you can continue with the upload step with all packages
   available. Also create a ZIP file from the CHM one:

    zip wxWidgets-x.y.z-docs-chm.zip wxWidgets-x.y.z.chm

   and copy/move it to the same directory.

5. Run `./build/tools/post-release.sh` to update the SHA-1 sums in
   `docs/release.md`, then commit the changes. Notice that when making an RC,
   the version must be explicitly specified on this script command line.

## Uploading

Create a new release on GitHub using vX.Y.Z tag and title.

Use the content of `docs/release.md` for the release description box.

Attach the following files to it:

    wxMSW-Setup-x.y.z.exe
    wxWidgets-x.y.z.7z
    wxWidgets-x.y.z.tar.bz2
    wxWidgets-x.y.z.zip
    wxWidgets-x.y.z-docs-chm.zip
    wxWidgets-x.y.z-docs-html.tar.bz2
    wxWidgets-x.y.z-docs-html.zip
    wxWidgets-x.y.z-headers.7z

## Update documentation

This requires being able to ssh to docs.wxwidgets.org, please ask Bryan if you
think you should be able to do it, but can't.

Once logged in, run `~/update-trunk-docs.sh` script to update files in
`public_html/trunk` directory, copy its contents to `public_html/x.y.z`, switch
any links, such as `3.1` to point to `x.y.z` by doing

    $ cd ~/public_html
    $ ln -sfn 3.y.z 3.y

and edit `~/public_html/index.html` to add the link to the new release to it.

If the docs must be generated from the tag itself, and not from master, note
that you need to apply the special commit which is always the tip of master
branch in `~/wxWidgets` git repository on this machine.

E.g. to create documentation for `v3.0.z` release:

    $ cd ~/wxWidgets
    $ git fetch --tags
    $ git checkout -b my-tmp-branch v3.0.z
    $ git cherry-pick master
    $ vi docs/doxygen/Doxyfile
    ... edit HTML_OUTPUT to create files in ~/public_html/3.0.z
    $ cd docs/doxygen
    $ PATH="$HOME/doxygen/bin:$PATH" WX_SKIP_DOXYGEN_VERSION_CHECK=1 nice -n 15 ./regen.sh php

    # Cleanup
    $ git reset --hard master
    $ git checkout master
    $ git branch -d my-tmp-branch

Note that the docs web site currently uses Cloudflare for caching, which means
that it won't update for several hours after the change, unless you purge the
cache manually in the Cloudflare console (which requires an account).

## Announcement

Update https://www.wxwidgets.org:
* Update release information (at least `version` and `released`) in `_data/releases.yml`.
* Update the list of compilers used for making MSW binaries in
  `downloads/index.md` if necessary (note that there is no need to update
  anything else, the page will dynamically show the release files with the
  specified prefixes).
* Add a news item. Usually a news item is enough but something
  more can be called for for major releases
* Push the changes (or create the PR with them) to GitHub. Note that this will
  trigger the site rebuild which will fail if the release statistics are not
  available yet, so make sure to publish the release on GitHub first (or wait
  an hour for the next scheduled site rebuild to happen).

Post `docs/publicity/announce.txt` at least to wx-announce@googlegroups.com and
to wx-users.

Submit a link to https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp or r/programming (depending on
the release importance).

Submit to https://isocpp.org/blog/suggest (need to be logged in to do it).

For major releases, submit the announcement to https://slashdot.org/submission

## Post-Release Steps

* Trac: mark the milestone corresponding to the release as completed and
add a new version for it to allow reporting bugs against it and create the
next milestone (ask Vadim or Robin to do it or to get admin password).

* Update the roadmap at https://trac.wxwidgets.org/wiki/Roadmap to at
least mention the new release there.

* Run `misc/scripts/inc_release` to increment micro version,
i.e. replace x.y.z with x.y.z+1.

* Update the C:R:A settings in `build/bakefiles/version.bkl` to C:R+1:A.
Then from the build/bakesfiles directory run

        bakefile_gen

and from the root directory run

        autoconf -B build/autoconf_prepend-include

* Restore the description of the Git notes use and create a skeleton section
  for the next release in `docs/changes.txt`.


## MSW Visual Studio Official Builds

To build official x86 and x64 shared binaries the following are prerequisites:

     - Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2015
     - Windows SDK 6.1, 7.1 (required for x64 builds for Visual Studio 2008, 2010)
     - 7z (required for packaging the files)
     - fciv (required for generating the checksums)

The VSxxxCOMNTOOLS environment variables are used to locate the tools required
for Visual Studio 2012, 2013 and 2015. There are no Microsoft defined variables
for the SDKs used for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010. The build will look for the
following environment variables for the Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 SDK tools:

WINDOWS61SDK
WINDOWS71SDK

If either of these are blank they are set to the default install location.

To build binaries for a single compiler, open a command prompt (for Visual
Studio 2008 only an SDK 6.1 developer's command prompt must be used),
cd to the build\tools\msvs folder and run the batch file 'officialbuild'
with the vcXXX version number:

    Visual Studio 2008  vc90
    Visual Studio 2010  vc100
    Visual Studio 2012  vc110
    Visual Studio 2014  vc120
    Visual Studio 2015  vc14x

The Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 are binary compatible, allowing the
vc14x binary to be used with any of them.

This will build all of the x86 and x64 binaries for the selected compiler version,
package them in 7z files and calculate the checksums. The 7z files and the
checksums are output to the build\msw\packages folder.

All of the compiler packages can be built at the same time by executing the
build\tools\msvs\buildall.bat file from a command prompt. Each build will be
launched in its own shell.
