<P>

This page represents current thinking about where wxWindows is going in the near, 
medium and long-term. It also serves as a schedule for new releases so
that both developers and users can know what to expect when, at least approximately.<P>

Note (1): as the wxWindows effort is voluntary, these are not hard-and-fast deadlines:
but we will endeavour to follow them as closely as possible.<P>

Note (2): the releases described are for wxGTK, wxMSW and wxMotif ports. wxMac currently follows
its own development path but is due to merge with the main code base in November/December.
Also, minor snapshot releases for specific platforms may be
available at dates convenient to the developers.<P>

<H4>Release 2.0.?</H4>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>Release date: November 7th, 1999

combined base/GUI library for GUI applications only.
<li>New wxGrid.
<li>wxSocket working.
<li>wxHTML printing (possibly).
<li>Better i18n support (i.e. more translations)
<li>Animation classes (possibly, low priority).
<li>PCX writing capability (possibly, low priority).
<li>wxImage handlers in separate .h and .cpp files.
<li>Rewritten timer.cpp, possible wxChrono class.
<li>Bug tracking system in place.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>wxHTML printing. When finished, this will allow an application to generate
printed reports with very little effort.
<li>wxSocket.
<li>Split library into several, for base (classes and functions usable by console and GUI
applications), console (classes and functions usable by console application only)
and GUI (classes and functions usable by GUI application only).
<li>Extend and unify drag and drop handling (e.g. we need to specify multiple drop targets
that can handle multiple formats).
<li>Expand the number of controls that can be specified in a WXR file;
add constraint specification to WXR syntax and Dialog Editor; add multilanguage support to WXR.
May be we'd better change the format completely and replace WXR with XML
(providing conversion utility for old files)?
<li>Rewrite Dialog Editor.
<li>Modem-oriented classes: wxDialUpManager for dialing up the ISP and
determining if there is a connection to Internet on the machine and
wxPhoneDialer for dialing arbitrary phone numbers and otherwise communicating
with the modem.
<li>PCX writing code.
<li>GIF animation code.
<li>Tidying of timer code, addition of wxChrono class.
<li>Debug wxPostScriptDC further.
<li>wxDateTime class.
<li>Expansion of wxHTML to support further tags, and frames.
<li>MGL port (see Backroom/Future Ports page).
<li>Rotated text support.
<li>FreeType support.
<li>Support for 'skins', perhaps using a set of alternative control and window classes
written generically in wxWindows.
<li>Serial and parallel port support.
<li>Modem and telephony support.
<li>Book, tutorial.
<li>More examples.
</ul>

<P>

<B><I>wxMSW</I></B><P>

panel application.
