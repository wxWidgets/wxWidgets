<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="gettext_toc.html#TOC25">Translated Entries</A></H2>

<P>
Each PO file entry for which the <CODE>msgstr</CODE> field has been filled with
a translation, and which is not marked as fuzzy (see section <A HREF="gettext_5.html#SEC26">Fuzzy Entries</A>),
is a said to be a <STRONG>translated</STRONG> entry.  Only translated entries will
later be compiled by GNU <CODE>msgfmt</CODE> and become usable in programs.
Other entry types will be excluded; translation will not occur for them.

</P>
<P>
Some commands are more specifically related to translated entry processing.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>t</KBD>
<DD>
Find the next translated entry.

<DT><KBD>M-t</KBD>
<DD>
Find the previous translated entry.

</DL>

<P>
The commands <KBD>t</KBD> (<CODE>po-next-translated-entry</CODE>) and <KBD>M-t</KBD>
(<CODE>po-previous-transted-entry</CODE>) move forwards or backwards, chasing
for an translated entry.  If none is found, the search is extended and
wraps around in the PO file buffer.

</P>
<P>
Translated entries usually result from the translator having edited in
a translation for them, section <A HREF="gettext_5.html#SEC29">Modifying Translations</A>.  However, if the
variable <CODE>po-auto-fuzzy-on-edit</CODE> is not <CODE>nil</CODE>, the entry having
received a new translation first becomes a fuzzy entry, which ought to
be later unfuzzied before becoming an official, genuine translated entry.
See section <A HREF="gettext_5.html#SEC26">Fuzzy Entries</A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="gettext_toc.html#TOC26">Fuzzy Entries</A></H2>

<P>
Each PO file entry may have a set of <STRONG>attributes</STRONG>, which are
qualities given an name and explicitely associated with the entry
translation, using a special system comment.  One of these attributes
has the name <CODE>fuzzy</CODE>, and entries having this attribute are said
to have a fuzzy translation.  They are called fuzzy entries, for short.

</P>
<P>
Fuzzy entries, even if they account for translated entries for
most other purposes, usually call for revision by the translator.
Those may be produced by applying the program <CODE>msgmerge</CODE> to
update an older translated PO files according to a new PO template
file, when this tool hypothesises that some new <CODE>msgid</CODE> has
been modified only slightly out of an older one, and chooses to pair
what it thinks to be the old translation for the new modified entry.
The slight alteration in the original string (the <CODE>msgid</CODE> string)
should often be reflected in the translated string, and this requires
the intervention of the translator.  For this reason, <CODE>msgmerge</CODE>
might mark some entries as being fuzzy.

</P>
<P>
Also, the translator may decide herself to mark an entry as fuzzy
for her own convenience, when she wants to remember that the entry
has to be later revisited.  So, some commands are more specifically
related to fuzzy entry processing.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>f</KBD>
<DD>
Find the next fuzzy entry.

<DT><KBD>M-f</KBD>
<DD>
Find the previous fuzzy entry.

<DT><KBD>TAB</KBD>
<DD>
Remove the fuzzy attribute of the current entry.

</DL>

<P>
The commands <KBD>f</KBD> (<CODE>po-next-fuzzy</CODE>) and <KBD>M-f</KBD>
(<CODE>po-previous-fuzzy</CODE>) move forwards or backwards, chasing for
a fuzzy entry.  If none is found, the search is extended and wraps
around in the PO file buffer.

</P>
<P>
The command <KBD>TAB</KBD> (<CODE>po-unfuzzy</CODE>) removes the fuzzy
attribute associated with an entry, usually leaving it translated.
Further, if the variable <CODE>po-auto-select-on-unfuzzy</CODE> has not
the <CODE>nil</CODE> value, the <KBD>TAB</KBD> command will automatically chase
for another interesting entry to work on.  The initial value of
<CODE>po-auto-select-on-unfuzzy</CODE> is <CODE>nil</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The initial value of <CODE>po-auto-fuzzy-on-edit</CODE> is <CODE>nil</CODE>.  However,
if the variable <CODE>po-auto-fuzzy-on-edit</CODE> is set to <CODE>t</CODE>, any entry
edited through the <KBD>RET</KBD> command is marked fuzzy, as a way to ensure
some kind of double check, later.  In this case, the usual paradigm is
that an entry becomes fuzzy (if not already) whenever the translator
modifies it.  If she is satisfied with the translation, she then uses
<KBD>TAB</KBD> to pick another entry to work on, clearing the fuzzy attribute
on the same blow.  If she is not satisfied yet, she merely uses <KBD>SPC</KBD>
to chase another entry, leaving the entry fuzzy.

</P>
<P>
The translator may also use the <KBD>DEL</KBD> command
(<CODE>po-fade-out-entry</CODE>) over any translated entry to mark it as being
fuzzy, when she wants to easily leave a trace she wants to later return
working at this entry.

</P>
<P>
Also, when time comes to quit working on a PO file buffer with the <KBD>q</KBD>
command, the translator is asked for confirmation, if fuzzy string
still exists.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="gettext_toc.html#TOC27">Untranslated Entries</A></H2>

<P>
When <CODE>xgettext</CODE> originally creates a PO file, unless told
otherwise, it initializes the <CODE>msgid</CODE> field with the untranslated
string, and leaves the <CODE>msgstr</CODE> string to be empty.  Such entries,
having an empty translation, are said to be <STRONG>untranslated</STRONG> entries.
Later, when the programmer slightly modifies some string right in
the program, this change is later reflected in the PO file
by the appearance of a new untranslated entry for the modified string.

</P>
<P>
The usual commands moving from entry to entry consider untranslated
entries on the same level as active entries.  Untranslated entries
are easily recognizable by the fact they end with <SAMP>`msgstr ""'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The work of the translator might be (quite naively) seen as the process
of seeking after an untranslated entry, editing a translation for
it, and repeating these actions until no untranslated entries remain.
Some commands are more specifically related to untranslated entry
processing.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>u</KBD>
<DD>
Find the next untranslated entry.

<DT><KBD>M-u</KBD>
<DD>
Find the previous untranslated entry.

<DT><KBD>k</KBD>
<DD>
Turn the current entry into an untranslated one.

</DL>

<P>
The commands <KBD>u</KBD> (<CODE>po-next-untranslated-entry</CODE>) and <KBD>M-u</KBD>
(<CODE>po-previous-untransted-entry</CODE>) move forwards or backwards,
chasing for an untranslated entry.  If none is found, the search is
extended and wraps around in the PO file buffer.

</P>
<P>
An entry can be turned back into an untranslated entry by
merely emptying its translation, using the command <KBD>k</KBD>
(<CODE>po-kill-msgstr</CODE>).  See section <A HREF="gettext_5.html#SEC29">Modifying Translations</A>.

</P>
<P>
Also, when time comes to quit working on a PO file buffer
with the <KBD>q</KBD> command, the translator is asked for confirmation,
if some untranslated string still exists.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="gettext_toc.html#TOC28">Obsolete Entries</A></H2>

<P>
By <STRONG>obsolete</STRONG> PO file entries, we mean those entries which are
commented out, usually by <CODE>msgmerge</CODE> when it found that the
translation is not needed anymore by the package being localized.

</P>
<P>
The usual commands moving from entry to entry consider obsolete
entries on the same level as active entries.  Obsolete entries are
easily recognizable by the fact that all their lines start with
<KBD>#</KBD>, even those lines containing <CODE>msgid</CODE> or <CODE>msgstr</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Commands exist for emptying the translation or reinitializing it
to the original untranslated string.  Commands interfacing with the
kill ring may force some previously saved text into the translation.
The user may interactively edit the translation.  All these commands
may apply to obsolete entries, carefully leaving the entry obsolete
after the fact.

</P>
<P>
Moreover, some commands are more specifically related to obsolete
entry processing.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>o</KBD>
<DD>
Find the next obsolete entry.

<DT><KBD>M-o</KBD>
<DD>
Find the previous obsolete entry.

<DT><KBD>DEL</KBD>
<DD>
Make an active entry obsolete, or zap out an obsolete entry.

</DL>

<P>
The commands <KBD>o</KBD> (<CODE>po-next-obsolete-entry</CODE>) and <KBD>M-o</KBD>
(<CODE>po-previous-obsolete-entry</CODE>) move forwards or backwards,
chasing for an obsolete entry.  If none is found, the search is
extended and wraps around in the PO file buffer.

</P>
<P>
PO mode does not provide ways for un-commenting an obsolete entry
and making it active, because this would reintroduce an original
untranslated string which does not correspond to any marked string
in the program sources.  This goes with the philosophy of never
introducing useless <CODE>msgid</CODE> values.

</P>
<P>
However, it is possible to comment out an active entry, so making
it obsolete.  GNU <CODE>gettext</CODE> utilities will later react to the
disappearance of a translation by using the untranslated string.
The command <KBD>DEL</KBD> (<CODE>po-fade-out-entry</CODE>) pushes the current entry
a little further towards annihilation.  If the entry is active (it is a
translated entry), then it is first made fuzzy.  If it is already fuzzy,
then the entry is merely commented out, with confirmation.  If the entry
is already obsolete, then it is completely deleted from the PO file.
It is easy to recycle the translation so deleted into some other PO file
entry, usually one which is untranslated.  See section <A HREF="gettext_5.html#SEC29">Modifying Translations</A>.

</P>
<P>
Here is a quite interesting problem to solve for later development of
PO mode, for those nights you are not sleepy.  The idea would be that
PO mode might become bright enough, one of these days, to make good
guesses at retrieving the most probable candidate, among all obsolete
entries, for initializing the translation of a newly appeared string.
I think it might be a quite hard problem to do this algorithmically, as
we have to develop good and efficient measures of string similarity.
Right now, PO mode completely lets the decision to the translator,
when the time comes to find the adequate obsolete translation, it
merely tries to provide handy tools for helping her to do so.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="gettext_toc.html#TOC29">Modifying Translations</A></H2>

<P>
PO mode prevents direct edition of the PO file, by the usual
means Emacs give for altering a buffer's contents.  By doing so,
it pretends helping the translator to avoid little clerical errors
about the overall file format, or the proper quoting of strings,
as those errors would be easily made.  Other kinds of errors are
still possible, but some may be caught and diagnosed by the batch
validation process, which the translator may always trigger by the
<KBD>V</KBD> command.  For all other errors, the translator has to rely on
her own judgment, and also on the linguistic reports submitted to her
by the users of the translated package, having the same mother tongue.

</P>
<P>
When the time comes to create a translation, correct an error diagnosed
mechanically or reported by a user, the translators have to resort to
using the following commands for modifying the translations.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>RET</KBD>
<DD>
Interactively edit the translation.

<DT><KBD>LFD</KBD>
<DD>
Reinitialize the translation with the original, untranslated string.

<DT><KBD>k</KBD>
<DD>
Save the translation on the kill ring, and delete it.

<DT><KBD>w</KBD>
<DD>
Save the translation on the kill ring, without deleting it.

<DT><KBD>y</KBD>
<DD>
Replace the translation, taking the new from the kill ring.

</DL>

<P>
The command <KBD>RET</KBD> (<CODE>po-edit-msgstr</CODE>) opens a new Emacs window
containing a copy of the translation taken from the current PO file entry,
all ready for edition, fully modifiable and with the complete extent of
GNU Emacs modifying commands.  The string is presented to the translator
expunged of all quoting marks, and she will modify the <EM>unquoted</EM>
string in this window to heart's content.  Once done, the regular Emacs
command <KBD>M-C-c</KBD> (<CODE>exit-recursive-edit</CODE>) may be used to return the
edited translation into the PO file, replacing the original translation.
The keys <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD> are bound so they have the same effect as
<KBD>M-C-c</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
If the translator becomes unsatisfied with her translation to the extent
she prefers keeping the translation which was existent prior to the
<KBD>RET</KBD> command, she may use the standard Emacs command <KBD>C-]</KBD>
(<CODE>abort-recursive-edit</CODE>) to merely get rid of edition, while
preserving the original translation.  The keys <KBD>C-c C-k</KBD> are
bound so they have the same effect as <KBD>C-]</KBD>.  Another way would
be for her to exit normally with <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD>, then type <CODE>U</CODE>
once for undoing the whole effect of last edition.

</P>
<P>
Functions found on <CODE>po-subedit-mode-hook</CODE>, if any, are executed after
the string has been inserted in the edit buffer and before recursive edit
is entered.

</P>
<P>
While editing her translation, the translator should pay attention to
not inserting unwanted <KBD><KBD>RET</KBD></KBD> (carriage returns) characters at
the end of the translated string if those are not meant to be there,
or to removing such characters when they are required.  Since these
characters are not visible in the editing buffer, they are easily
introduced by mistake.  To help her, <KBD><KBD>RET</KBD></KBD> automatically puts
the character <KBD>&#60;</KBD> at the end of the string being edited, but this
<KBD>&#60;</KBD> is not really part of the string.  On exiting the editing
window with <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD>, PO mode automatically removes such
<KBD>&#60;</KBD> and all whitespace added after it.  If the translator adds
characters after the terminating <KBD>&#60;</KBD>, it looses its delimiting
property and integrally becomes part of the string.  If she removes
the delimiting <KBD>&#60;</KBD>, then the edited string is taken <EM>as
is</EM>, with all trailing newlines, even if invisible.  Also, if the
translated string ought to end itself with a genuine <KBD>&#60;</KBD>, then the
delimiting <KBD>&#60;</KBD> may not be removed; so the string should appear,
in the editing window, as ending with two <KBD>&#60;</KBD> in a row.

</P>
<P>
When a translation (or a comment) is being edited, the translator
may move the cursor back into the PO file buffer and freely
move to other entries, browsing at will.  The edited entry will
be recovered as soon as the edit ceases, because it is this entry
only which is being modified.  If, with an edition still opened, the
translator wanders in the PO file buffer, she cannot modify
any other entry.  If she tries to, PO mode will react by suggesting
that she abort the current edit, or else, by inviting her to finish
the current edit prior to any other modification.

</P>
<P>
The command <KBD>LFD</KBD> (<CODE>po-msgid-to-msgstr</CODE>) initializes, or
reinitializes the translation with the original string.  This command
is normally used when the translator wants to redo a fresh translation
of the original string, disregarding any previous work.

</P>
<P>
It is possible to arrange so, whenever editing an untranslated
entry, the <KBD>LFD</KBD> command be automatically executed.  If you set
<CODE>po-auto-edit-with-msgid</CODE> to <CODE>t</CODE>, the translation gets
initialised with the original string, in case none exist already.
The default value for <CODE>po-auto-edit-with-msgid</CODE> is <CODE>nil</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In fact, whether it is best to start a translation with an empty
string, or rather with a copy of the original string, is a matter of
taste or habit.  Sometimes, the source language and the
target language are so different that is simply best to start writing
on an empty page.  At other times, the source and target languages
are so close that it would be a waste to retype a number of words
already being written in the original string.  A translator may also
like having the original string right under her eyes, as she will
progressively overwrite the original text with the translation, even
if this requires some extra editing work to get rid of the original.

</P>
<P>
The command <KBD>k</KBD> (<CODE>po-kill-msgstr</CODE>) merely empties the
translation string, so turning the entry into an untranslated
one.  But while doing so, its previous contents is put apart in
a special place, known as the kill ring.  The command <KBD>w</KBD>
(<CODE>po-kill-ring-save-msgstr</CODE>) has also the effect of taking a
copy of the translation onto the kill ring, but it otherwise leaves
the entry alone, and does <EM>not</EM> remove the translation from the
entry.  Both commands use exactly the Emacs kill ring, which is shared
between buffers, and which is well known already to GNU Emacs lovers.

</P>
<P>
The translator may use <KBD>k</KBD> or <KBD>w</KBD> many times in the course
of her work, as the kill ring may hold several saved translations.
From the kill ring, strings may later be reinserted in various
Emacs buffers.  In particular, the kill ring may be used for moving
translation strings between different entries of a single PO file
buffer, or if the translator is handling many such buffers at once,
even between PO files.

</P>
<P>
To facilitate exchanges with buffers which are not in PO mode, the
translation string put on the kill ring by the <KBD>k</KBD> command is fully
unquoted before being saved: external quotes are removed, multi-lines
strings are concatenated, and backslashed escaped sequences are turned
into their corresponding characters.  In the special case of obsolete
entries, the translation is also uncommented prior to saving.

</P>
<P>
The command <KBD>y</KBD> (<CODE>po-yank-msgstr</CODE>) completely replaces the
translation of the current entry by a string taken from the kill ring.
Following GNU Emacs terminology, we then say that the replacement
string is <STRONG>yanked</STRONG> into the PO file buffer.
See section `Yanking' in <CITE>The Emacs Editor</CITE>.
The first time <KBD>y</KBD> is used, the translation receives the value of
the most recent addition to the kill ring.  If <KBD>y</KBD> is typed once
again, immediately, without intervening keystrokes, the translation
just inserted is taken away and replaced by the second most recent
addition to the kill ring.  By repeating <KBD>y</KBD> many times in a row,
the translator may travel along the kill ring for saved strings,
until she finds the string she really wanted.

</P>
<P>
When a string is yanked into a PO file entry, it is fully and
automatically requoted for complying with the format PO files should
have.  Further, if the entry is obsolete, PO mode then appropriately
push the inserted string inside comments.  Once again, translators
should not burden themselves with quoting considerations besides, of
course, the necessity of the translated string itself respective to
the program using it.

</P>
<P>
Note that <KBD>k</KBD> or <KBD>w</KBD> are not the only commands pushing strings
on the kill ring, as almost any PO mode command replacing translation
strings (or the translator comments) automatically save the old string
on the kill ring.  The main exceptions to this general rule are the
yanking commands themselves.

</P>
<P>
To better illustrate the operation of killing and yanking, let's
use an actual example, taken from a common situation.  When the
programmer slightly modifies some string right in the program, his
change is later reflected in the PO file by the appearance
of a new untranslated entry for the modified string, and the fact
that the entry translating the original or unmodified string becomes
obsolete.  In many cases, the translator might spare herself some work
by retrieving the unmodified translation from the obsolete entry,
then initializing the untranslated entry <CODE>msgstr</CODE> field with
this retrieved translation.  Once this done, the obsolete entry is
not wanted anymore, and may be safely deleted.

</P>
<P>
When the translator finds an untranslated entry and suspects that a
slight variant of the translation exists, she immediately uses <KBD>m</KBD>
to mark the current entry location, then starts chasing obsolete
entries with <KBD>o</KBD>, hoping to find some translation corresponding
to the unmodified string.  Once found, she uses the <KBD>DEL</KBD> command
for deleting the obsolete entry, knowing that <KBD>DEL</KBD> also <EM>kills</EM>
the translation, that is, pushes the translation on the kill ring.
Then, <KBD>r</KBD> returns to the initial untranslated entry, <KBD>y</KBD>
then <EM>yanks</EM> the saved translation right into the <CODE>msgstr</CODE>
field.  The translator is then free to use <KBD><KBD>RET</KBD></KBD> for fine
tuning the translation contents, and maybe to later use <KBD>u</KBD>,
then <KBD>m</KBD> again, for going on with the next untranslated string.

</P>
<P>
When some sequence of keys has to be typed over and over again, the
translator may find it useful to become better acquainted with the GNU
Emacs capability of learning these sequences and playing them back under
request.  See section `Keyboard Macros' in <CITE>The Emacs Editor</CITE>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="gettext_toc.html#TOC30">Modifying Comments</A></H2>

<P>
Any translation work done seriously will raise many linguistic
difficulties, for which decisions have to be made, and the choices
further documented.  These documents may be saved within the
PO file in form of translator comments, which the translator
is free to create, delete, or modify at will.  These comments may
be useful to herself when she returns to this PO file after a while.

</P>
<P>
Comments not having whitespace after the initial <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>, for example,
those beginning with <SAMP>`#.'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`#:'</SAMP>, are <EM>not</EM> translator
comments, they are exclusively created by other <CODE>gettext</CODE> tools.
So, the commands below will never alter such system added comments,
they are not meant for the translator to modify.  See section <A HREF="gettext_2.html#SEC9">The Format of PO Files</A>.

</P>
<P>
The following commands are somewhat similar to those modifying translations,
so the general indications given for those apply here.  See section <A HREF="gettext_5.html#SEC29">Modifying Translations</A>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>#</KBD>
<DD>
Interactively edit the translator comments.

<DT><KBD>K</KBD>
<DD>
Save the translator comments on the kill ring, and delete it.

<DT><KBD>W</KBD>
<DD>
Save the translator comments on the kill ring, without deleting it.

<DT><KBD>Y</KBD>
<DD>
Replace the translator comments, taking the new from the kill ring.

</DL>

<P>
These commands parallel PO mode commands for modifying the translation
strings, and behave much the same way as they do, except that they handle
this part of PO file comments meant for translator usage, rather
than the translation strings.  So, if the descriptions given below are
slightly succinct, it is because the full details have already been given.
See section <A HREF="gettext_5.html#SEC29">Modifying Translations</A>.

</P>
<P>
The command <KBD>#</KBD> (<CODE>po-edit-comment</CODE>) opens a new Emacs
window containing a copy of the translator comments on the current
PO file entry.  If there are no such comments, PO mode
understands that the translator wants to add a comment to the entry,
and she is presented with an empty screen.  Comment marks (<KBD>#</KBD>) and
the space following them are automatically removed before edition,
and reinstated after.  For translator comments pertaining to obsolete
entries, the uncommenting and recommenting operations are done twice.
Once in the editing window, the keys <KBD>C-c C-c</KBD> allow the
translator to tell she is finished with editing the comment.

</P>
<P>
Functions found on <CODE>po-subedit-mode-hook</CODE>, if any, are executed after
the string has been inserted in the edit buffer and before recursive edit
is entered.

</P>
<P>
The command <KBD>K</KBD> (<CODE>po-kill-comment</CODE>) get rid of all
translator comments, while saving those comments on the kill ring.
The command <KBD>W</KBD> (<CODE>po-kill-ring-save-comment</CODE>) takes
a copy of the translator comments on the kill ring, but leaves
them undisturbed in the current entry.  The command <KBD>Y</KBD>
(<CODE>po-yank-comment</CODE>) completely replaces the translator comments
by a string taken at the front of the kill ring.  When this command
is immediately repeated, the comments just inserted are withdrawn,
and replaced by other strings taken along the kill ring.

</P>
<P>
On the kill ring, all strings have the same nature.  There is no
distinction between <EM>translation</EM> strings and <EM>translator
comments</EM> strings.  So, for example, let's presume the translator
has just finished editing a translation, and wants to create a new
translator comment to document why the previous translation was
not good, just to remember what was the problem.  Foreseeing that she
will do that in her documentation, the translator may want to quote
the previous translation in her translator comments.  To do so, she
may initialize the translator comments with the previous translation,
still at the head of the kill ring.  Because editing already pushed the
previous translation on the kill ring, she merely has to type <KBD>M-w</KBD>
prior to <KBD>#</KBD>, and the previous translation will be right there,
all ready for being introduced by some explanatory text.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, presume there are some translator comments already
and that the translator wants to add to those comments, instead
of wholly replacing them.  Then, she should edit the comment right
away with <KBD>#</KBD>.  Once inside the editing window, she can use the
regular GNU Emacs commands <KBD>C-y</KBD> (<CODE>yank</CODE>) and <KBD>M-y</KBD>
(<CODE>yank-pop</CODE>) to get the previous translation where she likes.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="gettext_toc.html#TOC31">Consulting Auxiliary PO Files</A></H2>

<P>
PO mode is able to help the knowledgeable translator, being fluent in
many languages, at taking advantage of translations already achieved
in other languages she just happens to know.  It provides these other
language translations as additional context for her own work.  Moreover,
it has features to ease the production of translations for many languages
at once, for translators preferring to work in this way.

</P>
<P>
An <STRONG>auxiliary</STRONG> PO file is an existing PO file meant for the same
package the translator is working on, but targeted to a different mother
tongue language.  Commands exist for declaring and handling auxiliary
PO files, and also for showing contexts for the entry under work.

</P>
<P>
Here are the auxiliary file commands available in PO mode.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>a</KBD>
<DD>
Seek auxiliary files for another translation for the same entry.

<DT><KBD>M-a</KBD>
<DD>
Switch to a particular auxiliary file.

<DT><KBD>A</KBD>
<DD>
Declare this PO file as an auxiliary file.

<DT><KBD>M-A</KBD>
<DD>
Remove this PO file from the list of auxiliary files.

<P>
Command <KBD>A</KBD> (<CODE>po-consider-as-auxiliary</CODE>) adds the current
PO file to the list of auxiliary files, while command <KBD>M-A</KBD>
(<CODE>po-ignore-as-auxiliary</CODE> just removes it.

</P>
<P>
The command <KBD>a</KBD> (<CODE>po-cycle-auxiliary</CODE>) seeks all auxiliary PO
files, round-robin, searching for a translated entry in some other language
having an <CODE>msgid</CODE> field identical as the one for the current entry.
The found PO file, if any, takes the place of the current PO file in
the display (its window gets on top).  Before doing so, the current PO
file is also made into an auxiliary file, if not already.  So, <KBD>a</KBD>
in this newly displayed PO file will seek another PO file, and so on,
so repeating <KBD>a</KBD> will eventually yield back the original PO file.

</P>
<P>
The command <KBD>M-a</KBD> (<CODE>po-select-auxiliary</CODE>) asks the translator
for her choice of a particular auxiliary file, with completion, and
then switches to that selected PO file.  The command also checks if
the selected file has an <CODE>msgid</CODE> field identical as the one for
the current entry, and if yes, this entry becomes current.  Otherwise,
the cursor of the selected file is left undisturbed.

</P>
<P>
For all this to work fully, auxiliary PO files will have to be normalized,
in that way that <CODE>msgid</CODE> fields should be written <EM>exactly</EM>
the same way.  It is possible to write <CODE>msgid</CODE> fields in various
ways for representing the same string, different writing would break the
proper behaviour of the auxiliary file commands of PO mode.  This is not
expected to be much a problem in practice, as most existing PO files have
their <CODE>msgid</CODE> entries written by the same GNU <CODE>gettext</CODE> tools.

</P>
<P>
However, PO files initially created by PO mode itself, while marking
strings in source files, are normalised differently.  So are PO
files resulting of the the <SAMP>`M-x normalize'</SAMP> command.  Until these
discrepancies between PO mode and other GNU <CODE>gettext</CODE> tools get
fully resolved, the translator should stay aware of normalisation issues.
