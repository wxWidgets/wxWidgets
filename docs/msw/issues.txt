Current issues and bugs
-----------------------

Debugging code
--------------

wxDebugContext and global memory operators doesn't work correctly,
for different (unresolved) reasons on different compilers.

1) In VC++ 5.0, if you use wxDebugAlloc for new and wxDebugFree
for delete, you get a crash to do with deallocating the debug
buffer in wxDebugContext. So although the global operators are
defined, they are #ifdefed to just call malloc and free to avoid
the problem. This means that non-object memory checking doesn't work.
The problem does seem to be something to do with a pointer
mysteriously changing its address, very similar to 2).

2) In BC++ 4.5, there isn't a crash, but instead the ofstream
pointer passed to SetStream from SetFile (which is called in
memcheck.cpp) gets mysteriously changed as it's passed to SetStream.
This means that when counting the number of outstanding memory
blocks, we can't compare the allocated block with m_debugStream
to say 'ignore this block because we can't free it before the
very end of the application'. Therefore it always looks like
there's a memory leak of one object, in memory.cpp, unless you
don't call wxDebugContext::SetFile.

The fact that pointers appear to change in both cases must
indicate a common problem and solution. If we could use the
standard global memory operators for ofstream and
wxDebugStreamBuf it might help, but I don't know how to do that -
I've redefined 'new' throughout as WXDEBUG_NEW (which is itself
defined as the 3-argument operator).

Config/registry classes
-----------------------

Problems with Karsten's/Vadim's existing AppConfig classes:

- use char* a lot instead of wxString
- rather hard to understand
- will need fairly substantial rewrite
- no native .ini functions (?) for guaranteed Windows
  compatibility
- new wxWin docs required

Good things:

- exists!
- FileConfig independent of OS
- specifying a base class that will meet nearly all needs for
  derived classes
- enumerator

Other features we should probably have:

- ability to specify vendor name/app name in constructor
- under Windows, ability to read/write all areas of registry
  as an option

Options:

- rewrite AppConfig
- start from own CRegistry class
- take elements from both
- do the Windows stuff, let someone else write/adapt the
  non-Windows classes

Owner-draw menus
----------------

If USE_OWNER_DRAWN = 1 and you create a wxMenu, you get 'all bets
are off' memory checking warnings from wxWindows.
