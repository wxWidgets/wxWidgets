Installing wxWindows 2.0
------------------------

Unarchiving
-----------

If there is a setup program, run the setup program that comes with the Windows version.
Do not install into a path that contains spaces. The installation program should set the
WXWIN environment variable, which will be activated when your machine is rebooted.

If there is no setup program, it will come as a series of .zip
files:

wx200gen.zip            Generic source code and samples (required)
wx200msw.zip            Windows-specific source code and samples (required)
wx200doc.zip            Documentation source code (not required)
wx200hlp.zip            WinHelp documentation
wx200ps.zip             PostScript documentation (will probably
                        disappear in favour of PDF)
wx200pdf.zip            Acrobat PDF documentation
wx200htm.zip            HTML documentation

Unarchive the required files plus any optional documentation
files into a suitable directory such as c:\wx. Alter your
WXWIN environment variable to point to this directory.

Compilation
-----------

At present, wxWindows compiles with VC++ 1.5, VC++ 4.0, VC++ 5.0,
BC++ 4.5/5.0, Gnu-Win32 b19, and Mingw32.

Visual C++ 4.0/5.0 compilation
------------------------------

1. Change directory to wx\src\msw. Type 'nmake -f makefile.nt' to
   make the wxWindows core library.
2. Change directory to wx\samples and type 'nmake -f makefile.nt'
   to make all the samples. You can also make them individually.

Visual C++ 1.5 compilation
--------------------------

1. Change directory to wx\src\msw. Type 'nmake -f makefile.dos' to
   make the wxWindows core library.
2. Change directory to wx\samples and type 'nmake -f makefile.b32'
   to make all the samples. You can also make them individually.
   NOTE: only a few samples have up-to-date makefiles, e.g.
   minimal, docview, mdi. The utils makefile does not yet work.

Borland C++ 4.5/5.0 compilation
-------------------------------

1. Change directory to wx\src\msw. Type 'make -f makefile.b32' to
   make the wxWindows core library.
2. Change directory to wx\samples and type 'make -f makefile.b32'
   to make all the samples. You can also make them individually.
   NOTE: only a few samples have up-to-date makefiles, e.g.
   minimal, docview, mdi. The utils makefile does not yet work.

Gnu-Win32 b19/Mingw32 compilation
---------------------------------

wxWindows 2.0 supports Gnu-Win32 b19, Mingw32, and Mingw32/EGCS.

Thanks are due to Keith Garry Boyce (garp@opustel.com) and Cygnus for making
it all possible.

From wxWindows 2.0 beta 9, both Gnu-Win32 b19 and Mingw32 (the minimal
distribution of Gnu-Win32) can be used with the same makefiles.

Here are the steps required:

- Retrieve and install the latest beta of Gnu-Win32, or Mingw32, as per the
  instructions with either of these packages.

- If using Mingw32 (including the EGCS variant), you need some
  extra files to use the wxWindows makefiles. You can find these
  files in ports/mingw32 on the ftp site or CD-ROM, as extra.zip.
  These should be extracted to the Mingw32 directory.

- Modify the file wx/src/cygnus.bat (or mingw32.bat or mingegcs.bat)
  to set up appropriate variables, if necessary mounting drives.
  Run it before compiling.

- For Gnu-Win32, make sure there's a \tmp directory on your
  Windows drive or bison will crash.

- Edit wx/src/makeg95.env and search for MINGW32. Take note of
  the comments for adjusting settings to suit Gnu-Win32 or
  Mingw32. Basically, this is just a case of adding the __MINGW32__ symbol
  to OPTIONS for Mingw32, or removing it for Cygnus Gnu-Win32.
  For Mingw32/EGCS, add both __MINGW32__ and __EGCS__.

- Use the makefile.g95 files for compiling wxWindows and samples,
  e.g.:
  > cd c:\wx\src\msw
  > make -f makefile.g95
  > cd c:\wx\samples\minimal
  > make -f makefile.g95

- Use the 'strip' command to reduce executable size.

- With Cygnus Gnu-Win32, you can invoke gdb --nw myfile.exe to
  debug an executable.

- If using GnuWin32 b18, you will need to copy windres.exe
  from e.g. the Mingw32 distribution, to a directory in your path.

All targets have 'clean' targets to allow removal of object files
and other intermediate compiler files.

Gotchas:

- libwx.a is 28 MB or more.
- install.exe doesn't have built-in decompression because lzexpand.lib
  isn't available with Gnu-Win32. However, you can use it with external
  decompression utilities.
