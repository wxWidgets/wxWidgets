General guidelines for
wxWin/CE porting contributors.

1.
define __WXMSW__ when __WXWINCE__ is defined. 
In other words:
both __WXMSW__ and __WXWINCE__ defined => wxWinCE compilation
just __WXMSW__ defined => wxMSW compilation
Because: Not defining __WXMSW__ for wxWinCE port means that all code doing anything
Win32-specific would need to be changed to work with wxWinCE which doesn't
seem at all like a good idea. (VZ)

2. 
Shorter way is preferred
#if (defined(STRICT) || defined(__GNUC__)) && !defined(__WXWINCE__)
Because: Shorter code, single case intead of multiple one (JS)

3.
it's a good idea to separate GUI details from platform details.
It would seem logical to do the same for Windows with WIN32 for the "system"
functions and WXMSW and WXWINCE for the places where GUI's are different.
If something is really a WIN32 function, #ifdef WIN32 seems much more
logical than "#if defined(__WXMSW__) || defined(__WXWINCE__)"
Because: Just imagine all the common unix stuff where within "#if defined(__WXGTK__)||
defined(__WXMOTIF__)||defined(__WXX11)" and the mess that would create
when trying to compile any of those 3 ports on OS/2, Windows or MacOS. (SN)

4.
Project that are not involved with the DLL creation should be stored in another level.
Maybe something like /src/msw/wince/mywxbase
Because: The main directory remain clearer. (MC)

5. Definitely do not use #if defined (__WXWINCE__) in common headers or not MSW headers (JS)


6. Note that wx/msw/private.h shouldn't be included neither from the
headers -- only from the .cpp files. And there you should include it after
everything, i.e.:
#include "wx/dc.h"
...
#include "wx/msw/private.h"
(VZ)

7. Use following replacements to verify device you are building for:
#ifdef WIN32_PLATFORM_WFSP      == #if defined(__WXWINCE__) && defined(__SMARTPHONE__)
#ifdef WIN32_PLATFORM_PSPC      == #if defined(__WXWINCE__) && defined(__PDA__)
#ifdef WCE_PLATFORM_STANDARDSDK == #if defined(__WINCE_STANDARDSDK__)
#if WinCE but non of above      == #if defined(__WXWINCE__) && defined(__HANDHELD__)
