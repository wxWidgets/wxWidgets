Building wxGTK port with Win32 MSys2 GDK backend
------------------------------------------------

GTK+ widget toolkit has multiple GDK backends and one of them is Win32.
It is a wrapper around Windows API.

These notes don't consider building wxGTK with X11 backend under Windows.

The MSys2 website is http://www.msys2.org/

These building steps are NOT the normal way to build MSys2 MinGW packages.
But, they are a way the wxWidgets developers can test that wxWidgets
can build the wxGTK/Win32 libraries under MSys2 MinGW.

For the MSys2 way please see https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages

Building steps:

#Note: The "#" is used in front of a comment to help the people who cut
#      and paste these directions.
#Warning: At the time these directions were written the GTK version 3
#         was NOT able to create wxGTK/Win32 libraries that were usable.

#1. Install the mingw32 packages needed to build wxGTK/Win32 using the 
#   configure/make build method. 
#   From the MSys2 prompt or MSys2 MinGW prompt:

#   The 32 bit Mingw packages are prefixed with "mingw-w64-i686-";
#   Change the prefix to "mingw-w64-x86_64-" if you wish to do 64 bit.

pacman -S autoconf
pacman -S make
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libjpeg-turbo
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libpng
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libtiff
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gtk2           
# gtk2 takes a very long time to install fontconfig
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-webkitgtk2
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-cppunit

# Packages that are needed but are normally installed already.
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc-libs
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-expat
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-xz
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-zlib
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gdk-pixbuf2


#2. Build the wxGTK/Win32 static library
#2a.Open MSys2 MinGW Prompt
#   (These steps were tested on MinGW32; but, should work under MinGW64)
#2b.Use the cd command to change directory to the wxWidgets top folder.


#2c.Create the "build-gtk2-static" folder to build the static libraries
mkdir -p build-gtk2-static

#2d.Configure wxWidgets
cd build-gtk2-static && \
  ../configure --with-gtk=2 \
    --disable-shared \
    --disable-mimetype \
  && cd ..

#2e.make the wxGTK static libraries
cd build-gtk2-static && make && cd ..


#3  Build and run the minimal static sample
#3a.Build the minimal sample
cd build-gtk2-static/samples/minimal && make && cd ../../..

#3b.Run the minimal sample
cd samples && ../build-gtk2-static/samples/minimal/minimal.exe && cd ..
