Todo on wxWin 2.0, Windows platform
-----------------------------------

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------

Find/add wxThread sample - Arthur T-D?

wxControl dimensions should be optionally based on dialog font
size for portability (dialog units as per Windows).

Implement wxDC floating point transformations.

Add wxDC::DeviceToLogical -> wxPoint etc (convenience accessors).

Revamp Dialog Editor for new controls and properties (e.g.
window id).

Tidy wxConfig API.

Change DnD classes to use global symbols, and wxString.

Update manual.

    wxHelpController classes DONE (except for Unix ones)
    wxString            PARTLY DONE
    Drag and drop (change API if required, e.g. const).
    wxCheckListBox
    wxAcceleratorTable
    wxBaseArray, other arrays
    (wxOwnerDrawn)
    Document the include file for each class
    Macros, e.g. wxASSERT
    Stream classes
    Functions

Write tutorial.

A wxDC function (or two) for drawing 3D edges.

Makefiles for other compilers. Generic makefiles?
Rewrite makefiles to maintain simultaneous debug/release
objects.

More wxSystemSettings (see comment in settings.cpp).

wxSocket integration.

Convert remaining utilities e.g. (GLCanvas; wxGraphLayout) and samples

Check TODO entries.

Shell function to invoke a document with open, print, whatever...

Make use of Vadim's gettext implementation throughout wxWin code.
Document it.

Retain callback functions; have semi-compatible callback function prototypes
for all controls, at least in WXWIN_COMPATIBLE mode, but
retain (Set)Callback for all compilations. This is following a
panicky response to losing callbacks.

Merge dib.cpp, dibutils.cpp.

Add a wxTabCtrl sample.

Improve printing. More API functions for printer DCs (to get
printer characteristics) and more reliable printing framework.

Add GetIcon, GetBitmap to wxImageList. Perhaps store bitmaps
in image list so we can get them later.

LOW PRIORITY
------------

Debug PNG support in wxBitmap (no 4-bit support), and possibly add a convertor from PNG
to HICON. We could perhaps also support inclusion of PNGs into
a .res file as a custom resource.

Fonts: ability to enumerate them.

Angled text.

Eliminate Set/GetDefaultBackgroundColour? Just take background
colour for child control instead.

Think about reimplementing wxBitmapButton, wxStaticBitmap using
BS_BITMAP, SS_BITMAP - but this may not allow wxBitmap
argument, so instead just allow controls loaded from native
resource to deal with this style and call default processing.

Better clipboard support.

wxWizard class?

Doc/view - have some standard views/docs e.g. wxTextView.

wxClassWizard for generating files, chunks of code.

Miscellaneous file/system function wrappers.

wxImage or replacement; further wxBitmap/wxIcon etc. functions
(load animated icos).

Integrate existing multimedia classes.

Rich text class?

Look at WinCE stuff incl. database classes.

Improve conversion guide, compatibility classes, tools?

Bug database.

ActiveX support?

OpenGL integration.

Menu bitmaps - document Vadim's enhancements.

Enhance Tex2RTF to generate Microsoft HTML help, perhaps Netscape
HTML help also.

wxCreateDynamicObject is apparently slow: ~ 2000 calls to strcmp. Need to
use some kind of hash table scheme.

Write wxDisplay class for querying settings and passing
to wxFrame to mirror the X situation (multiple displays).

Write translator between old and new .wxr formats (including
substituting static text for obsolete labels).

Improve and expand wxSizer classes.

Write more validators.

Classes for file/OS utility functions.

Add support for more static controls e.g. wxStaticLine.

GDI objects could be optimised further in constructors by
searching for a matching, pre-existing object, and assigning from
that, thus sharing the internal handle. A problem with this
arises if you wish to change the data. But this can be handled by
un-refing and creating a new handle. So we could reuse many
Windows GDI objects without troubling the programmer. We might
wish to switch this off in certain circumstances, e.g.

    wxEnableGDIReuse(FALSE);
    wxBrush brush(...);
    wxEnableGDIReuse(TRUE);

or even

    wxGDIReuse reuse(FALSE);
    wxBrush brush(...);

which lasts until its scope ends. This might be needed e.g. if we
needed to ensure that the operation was maximally efficient
(creating a new object rather than searching may or may not be
more efficient).

Perhaps rewrite wxFile to use FILE* descriptors, so Eof and Flush
can work.
