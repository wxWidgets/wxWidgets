Todo on wxWin 2, Windows platform
---------------------------------

HIGH PRIORITY
-------------

Add further controls and properties to Dialog Editor.

Add centring, right justify styles to wxStaticText.

Extend wxSystemSettings to get symbols for current nationality,
e.g. ',' instead of '.' for decimal points.

wxToolTip::Enable should be static for wxGTK compatibility (VZ)

LOW PRIORITY (MEDIUM TERM)
--------------------------

Supply VC++ project generator utility.

More wxSystemSettings (see comment in settings.cpp).

Shell function to invoke a document with open, print, whatever...

Write tutorial.

Add wxDC::DeviceToLogical -> wxPoint etc (convenience accessors).

Add GetIcon, GetBitmap to wxImageList. Perhaps store bitmaps
in image list so we can get them later.

Merge dib.cpp, dibutils.cpp (see also some DIB code in bitmap.cpp).

Menu bitmaps - document Vadim's enhancements.

wxCreateDynamicObject is apparently slow: ~ 2000 calls to strcmp. Need to
use some kind of hash table scheme.

Write wxDisplay class for querying settings and passing
to wxFrame to mirror the X situation (multiple displays).

Perhaps rewrite wxFile to use FILE* descriptors, so Eof and Flush
can work.

Find out how to set wxFileDialog position.

Implement wxDC floating point transformations.

A wxDC function (or two) for drawing 3D edges?

LOW PRIORITY (LONG TERM)
------------------------

ActiveX support

Look at porting to WinCE

GDI objects could be optimised further in constructors by
searching for a matching, pre-existing object, and assigning from
that, thus sharing the internal handle. A problem with this
arises if you wish to change the data. But this can be handled by
un-refing and creating a new handle. So we could reuse many
Windows GDI objects without troubling the programmer. We might
wish to switch this off in certain circumstances, e.g.

    wxEnableGDIReuse(FALSE);
    wxBrush brush(...);
    wxEnableGDIReuse(TRUE);

or even

    wxGDIReuse reuse(FALSE);
    wxBrush brush(...);

which lasts until its scope ends. This might be needed e.g. if we
needed to ensure that the operation was maximally efficient
(creating a new object rather than searching may or may not be
more efficient).

Integrate Guilhem's multimedia classes: documentation, makefiles,
different platforms.

Rich text class.
