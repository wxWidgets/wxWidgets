wxWidgets for Mac OS X installation
-----------------------------------

wxWidgets can be compiled using Apple's Cocoa or Carbon libraries.
Cocoa is the more modern library, and Carbon is the older deprecated library.

In wxWidgets 3, Cocoa is the recommended library.  While Carbon is still
supported by Apple, little new work is being done in Carbon.

Most Mac OS X developers should start by downloading and installing Xcode 
from http://developer.apple.com.  It is a free IDE from Apple that provides
all of the tools you need for working with wxWidgets.

After Xcode is installed, download wxWidgets-{version}.tar.bz2 and then 
double-click on it to unpack it to create a wxWidgets directory.

Next use Terminal (under Applications, Utilities, Terminal) to access a command 
prompt.  Use cd to change directories to your wxWidgets directory and execute 
one of the following sets of commands from the wxWidgets directory.

For Carbon, you'll need to have Xcode 3.x installed (you can also have Xcode 4.x
installed, but the Carbon build needs 3.x, and the /Developer directory which is
installed when you install Xcode 3.x.

---------

# Build the library for Cocoa (wxWidgets 2.9.0 and later)
mkdir build-cocoa-debug
cd build-cocoa-debug
../configure --enable-debug
make
# Build the samples and demos
cd samples; make;cd ..
cd demos;   make;cd ..

---------

# Build the library for Carbon
mkdir build-carbon-debug
cd build-carbon-debug
../configure --with-carbon --enable-debug --disable-shared --enable-macosx_arch=i386 --with-macosx-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk  CC=/Developer/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 CXX=/Developer/usr/bin/g++-4.2 LD=/Developer/usr/bin/ld
make
# Build the samples and demos
cd samples;make;cd ..
cd demos;  make;cd ..

---------

After the compilation completes, use Finder to run the samples and demos
  Go to build-cocoa-debug/samples to experiment with the Cocoa samples.
  Go to build-cocoa-debug/demos to experiment with the Cocoa demos.
  Go to build-carbon-debug/samples to experiment with the Carbon samples.
  Go to build-carbon-debug/demos to experiment with the Carbon demos.
Double-click on the executables which have an icon showing three small squares.
The source code for the samples is in wxWidgets/samples
The source code for the demos is in wxWidgets/demos

If you want to install the library into the system directories you'll need
to do this as root.  The accepted way of running commands as root is to
use the built-in sudo mechanism.  First of all, you must be using an
account marked as a "Computer Administrator".  Then

6) sudo make install
7) type <YOUR OWN PASSWORD>

Note that while using this method is okay for development, it is not
recommended that you require endusers to install wxWidgets into their
system directories in order to use your program.  One way to avoid this
is to configure wxWidgets with --disable-shared.  Another way to avoid
it is to make a framework for wxWidgets.  Making frameworks is beyond
the scope of this document.

Note:
It is rarely desirable to install non-Apple software into system directories.
By configuring the library with --disable-shared and using the full path
to wx-config with the --in-place option you can avoid installing the library.


Apple Developer Tools: Xcode
----------------------------

You can use the project in build/osx/wxcocoa.xcodeproj to build the Cocoa
version of wxWidgets (wxOSX/Cocoa) and build/osx/wxcarbon.xcodeproj to
build the Carbon version of wxWidgets (wxOSX/Carbon). There are also sample
projects supplied with the minimal sample.

Notice that the command line build above builds not just the library itself but
also wxrc tool which doesn't have its own Xcode project. If you need this tool,
the simplest possibility is to build it from the command line after installing
the libraries using commands like this:

$ cd utils/wxrc
$ g++ -o wxrc wxrc.cpp `wx-config --cxxflags --libs base,xml`

Creating universal binaries
---------------------------

The Xcode projects for the wxWidgets library and minimal project are set up
to create universal binaries.

If using the Apple command line tools, pass --enable-universal_binary when
configuring wxWidgets. This will create the libraries for all the supported
architectures, currently ppc, i386 and x86_64 when using Cocoa (Carbon isn't
available in 64 bit builds). You may explicitly specify the architectures to
use as a comma-separated list, e.g. --enable-universal_binary=i386,x86_64.

Notice that if you use wx-config --libs to link your application, the -arch
flags are not added automatically as it is possible to link e.g. x86_64-only
program to a "fat" library containing other architectures. If you want to
build a universal application, you need to add the necessary "-arch xxx" flags
to your project or makefile separately.

As an alternative to using --enable-universal_binary, you can build for
each architecture separately and then use the lipo tool to glue the
binaries together. Assuming building on a PPC system:

1. First build in the usual way to get the PPC library.

2. Then, build for Intel, in a different folder. This time use:

export CFLAGS="-g -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk -arch i386"
export LDFLAGS="-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk"

./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no \
  --target=i386-apple-darwin8 --host=powerpc-apple-darwin8 --build=i386-apple-darwin8

You will need to reverse the powerpc and i386 parameters everywhere to build PPC on an Intel
machine.

3. Use lipo to glue the binaries together.
