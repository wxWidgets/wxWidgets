                             wxWidgets Change Log
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This file contains the list of changes since wxWidgets 3.x, please see
      docs/changes_30.txt for the changes in the previous versions.


INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES SINCE 3.0.x:
=================================

Changes in behaviour not resulting in compilation errors
--------------------------------------------------------

- wxRegEx now uses PCRE library, changing the meaning of some regular
  expressions, please see the "Changes" section in wxRegEx documentation for
  more details.

- wxRibbonButtonBar::DeleteButton() now deletes and not just removes the button.

- Default interpolation mode in wxGDIPlusContext under MSW is now
  wxINTERPOLATION_DEFAULT and not wxINTERPOLATION_GOOD as in 3.0 for
  consistency with OS X, call SetInterpolationQuality() explicitly if needed.

- Calling wxYield() in wxMSW now generates wxEVT_IDLE events, just as in the
  other ports, but this can be unexpected for the applications not expecting
  their idle handlers to be called from inside wxYield().

- Creating wxBitmap with 0 width or height now always fails in all ports
  (it used to succeed in wxMSW).

- Using invalid flags with wxBoxSizer or wxGridSizer items now triggers asserts
  when done from the code or error messages when done in XRC. These asserts are
  best avoided by fixing the flags, but wxSizerFlags::DisableConsistencyChecks()
  can be used to globally suppress them until this can be done. Even less
  intrusively, environment variable WXSUPPRESS_SIZER_FLAGS_CHECK can be set (to
  any value) to achieve the same effect.

- wxWS_EX_VALIDATE_RECURSIVELY is now the default behaviour, i.e. calling
  Validate() or TransferData{From,To}Window() will now also call the same
  function for all children.

- wxOSX/Carbon port doesn't exist any more, wxOSX/Cocoa will be silently used
  instead even if configure --with-osx_carbon option is used.

- The pure virtual function wxAppTrait::GetToolkitVersion() now has a parameter
  for getting the micro version. If you override GetToolkitVersion() you need
  to add this new third parameter.

- wxWindow::CreateAccessible() doesn't return accessible object by default
  anymore and GetOrCreateAccessible() may return NULL, indicating that native
  system-provided accessibility should be used.

- wxMSW port doesn't always let the system process WM_SYSKEYDOWN events any
  more, make sure to call event.Skip() in your wxEVT_KEY_DOWN and/or wxEVT_CHAR
  event handlers if you want the standard key combinations such as Alt-Space or
  Alt-F4 to work.

- wxMSW port now uses better appearing but much slower pens for dotted and
  dashed lines. Use wxPenInfo::LowQuality() or wxPen::SetQuality() to return to
  the previous version behaviour and performance characteristics if you are
  drawing many lines using such pens.

- wxOSX port uses default button margins for wxBitmapButton by default, for
  consistency with the other ports. You now need to call SetMargins(0, 0)
  explicitly if you really don't want to have any margins in your buttons.

- wxEVT_AUINOTEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGED event is now sent after changing the page,
  as expected, and not before doing it.

- wxJoystickEvent::GetButtonChange() now returns "1 << N" for the events
  generated by the button number N under all platforms, whereas it used to
  return just "N" under Linux and macOS. Use the new GetButtonOrdinal() to
  update the existing code if necessary.

- Generic wxDataViewCtrl now always resizes its last column to fill all the
  available space, as the GTK+ version always did.

- wxGTK wxNotebook::AddPage() doesn't generate any events any more for the
  first page being added, for consistency with the other ports.

- wxGTK wxTextCtrl doesn't generate any wxEVT_TEXT when it's created with
  non-empty value, for consistency with the other ports.

- wxDC::GetTextExtent() returns height of 0 for empty string in wxGTK and wxOSX
  too now, for consistency with wxMSW and other kinds of wxDC.

- wxMSW wxToolBar height now adapts to the height of embedded controls, making
  the toolbar taller if necessary, rather than making the controls smaller. To
  return to the previous behaviour, you need to explicitly create controls of
  smaller size.

- wxDC::DrawCheckMark() draws the same shape under all platforms now, use the
  new wxRendererNative::DrawCheckMark() to draw MSW-specific themed check mark.

- wxTE_PROCESS_ENTER must be used to receive wxEVT_TEXT_ENTER events from even
  multiline wxTextCtrl, conforming to the documentation, but contrary to the
  previous behaviour in wxMSW, when these events were always generated in this
  case. Please add wxTE_PROCESS_ENTER style if you relied on the old behaviour.

- wxGLCanvas now uses physical pixels on high DPI displays under platforms
  where they're different from logical ones (wxGTK3, wxOSX). Multiply logical
  coordinates, e.g. returned by wxWindow::GetSize() by GetContentScaleFactor()
  before using them with OpenGL functions.

- wxGTK now uses wxID_NONE item ID for wxEVT_MENU_HIGHLIGHT events sent when
  there is no highlighted menu item, instead of wxID_ANY used before, for
  consistency with wxMSW.

- wxListCtrl::GetItemState() in wxMSW now checks the passed in item index for
  validity, as the generic version under the other platforms already did.

- wxAuiNotebook::RemovePage() now hides the removed page, so it needs to be
  shown again if it is reused in another place.

- wxSizer::RecalcSizes() shouldn't be called directly (note that it was never
  supposed to be called, only implemented), call Layout() instead.

- wxFileDialog::GetPath() and wxFileDialog::GetFilename() now assert and return
  an empty string if called on dialogs with the wxFD_MULTIPLE style.

- wxGetInstallPrefix() now returns wxString.

- wxChoice::GetString() now consistently asserts when passed an invalid index.

- wxSpinCtrlDouble now always resets its value to GetMin() if an invalid text
  string is passed to its SetValue(wxString) overload after its creation.

- wxSpinCtrl::SetValue(wxString) overload doesn't generate any events with
  wxMSW, which was already the documented behaviour.

- wxButton::GetBitmap{Current,Disabled,Focus,Pressed}() only return valid
  bitmaps in wxMSW if the corresponding Set had been called before, as in the
  other ports, instead of returning the normal bitmap as fallback in this case.

- wxFileName::GetVolume() now returns "\\share" and not just "share" for the
  UNC paths (i.e. \\share\path\on\remote\server) and "\\?\Volume{GUID}" for the
  volume GUID paths rather than just "Volume{GUID}" as before. This allows
  distinguishing them from the drive letters, even for single letter network
  share name.

- wxRichTextParagraph::GetLines() now returns const wxVector<wxRichTextLine*>&
  instead of wxList<wxRichTextLine*>&.

- wxDateTime::ParseRfc822Date() now interprets a 2-digit year as 19xx, or
  20xx for 00..29, whereas earlier e.g. 95 was interpreted literally as 95 AD.


Changes in behaviour which may result in build errors
-----------------------------------------------------

- wxBitmapComboBoxBase::SetItemBitmap() changed argument's type from wxBitmap
  to wxBitmapBundle.

- "webview" library is not included in `wx-config --libs` output any more, you
  need to request it explicitly, e.g. `wx-config --libs std,webview`.

- wxMSW now requires linking with uxtheme.lib, shlwapi.lib and version.lib.
  This is done automatically in most cases, but if you use a static build of
  the library with a non-MSVC compiler such as MinGW and do not use wx-config,
  then you will need to add these libraries to your make or project files
  yourself.

- wxPaintEvent objects can no longer be created by the application code. This
  was never supposed to work and is now forbidden at compile-time instead of
  resulting in errors during run-time.

- WXWIN_OS_DESCRIPTION doesn't exist any longer, use wxGetOsDescription().

- Never documented and not always available private wxGetClipboardData()
  function now doesn't exist at all any more in wxMSW, use wxClipboard instead.

- wxGraphicsRenderer::CreatePen() now takes wxGraphicsPenInfo and not a wxPen.
  This only affects code defining its own custom renderers, code just using
  wxGraphicsContext::CreatePen() continues to compile and work as before.

- wx/treebook.h doesn't include wx/treectrl.h (and, via it, wx/textctrl.h) any
  more, include these headers explicitly from your code if necessary.

- wxHtmlDCRenderer::Render() arguments have changed, simply omit the ones not
  existing in the function signature any more to update the code using it.

- wxHtmlCell::AdjustPagebreak() has lost its "known_pagebreaks" argument,
  update your code if you override this method (you shouldn't be calling it).

- wxListCtrl::SetItem() overload taking the column index now returns bool and
  not long. Its return value hasn't changed, however, and is still always
  either true or false, so normally the existing code should continue to work.

- configure only accepts the options it knows about now and doesn't silently
  ignore all the rest. If you get errors about unknown options, you may either
  specify --disable-option-checking argument to continue accepting them (which
  only ever makes sense if you pass these options to sub-configure scripts) or,
  e.g. if the error is due to spelling an option name wrongly, fixing or
  removing its name.

- wxTextValidator::Get{In,Ex}cludes() now return a const reference to
  wxArrayString. Please update your code to use the appropriate setter
  Set[Char]{In,Ex}cludes(), instead of mutating the internal data directly.

- Under macOS, 10.11 SDK is the minimum SDK, building and deploying under 10.10.5 and
  higher is supported, you must use at least Xcode 7.2.1.

- wxOSX Xcode projects no longer include the i386 target by default and,
  with Xcode 12 or later, build for the arm64 architecture in addition to
  existing x86_64. See build/osx/wxcocoa.xcconfig for more information.

- wxPGProperty ctors are not longer public since this class is intended to be
  a base class and should not be instantiated directly.

- wxIntProperty::DoValidation() and wxFloatProperty::DoValidation() are
  no longer public since they are helpers intended for internal use only.

- wxGridCellAttr ctor taking wxGridCellAttr pointer is now explicit.

- wxAuiPaneButton doesn't exist any more, it was never supposed to be used
  outside of the library, but if you did use, just use "int" button instead.

- wxAuiMDIChildFrame now inherits from wxFrame and not wxPanel, you will need
  to change your code and XRC definitions accordingly.

- wxGridEvent methods GetRow() and GetCol() are no longer virtual.

- wxImage constructor from XPM data is now explicit, write "wxImage(xpmData)"
  instead of just "xpmData" if you really need to use it.

- wxWindow::DoGetBorderSize() was removed, if you used this non-public function
  in your code, you can replace it with public GetWindowBorderSize().

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 (a.k.a. MSVC 7) is not supported any longer, the
  minimum required version is now 2005.
