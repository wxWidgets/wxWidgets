                             wxWidgets Change Log
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This file contains the list of changes since wxWidgets 3.2, please see
      docs/changes_32.txt for the earlier changes.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES SINCE 3.2.x:
=================================

Changes in behaviour not resulting in compilation errors
--------------------------------------------------------

- wxMSW now uses double buffering by default, meaning that updating the
  windows using wxClientDC doesn't work any longer, which is consistent with
  the behaviour of wxGTK with Wayland backend and of wxOSX, but not with the
  traditional historic behaviour of wxMSW (or wxGTK/X11). You may call
  MSWDisableComposited() to restore the previous behaviour, however it is
  strongly recommended to change your redrawing logic to avoid using wxClientDC
  instead, as the code using it still won't work with wxGTK/wxOSX.

- As first mentioned in 3.0 release notes, the value of wxTHREAD_WAIT_DEFAULT,
  used by wxThread::Delete() and Wait() by default, has changed from
  wxTHREAD_WAIT_YIELD to wxTHREAD_WAIT_BLOCK for safety and consistency.

- wxDocument::OnCloseDocument() was called twice in previous versions when
  closing the document from the menu. Now it is only called once and after
  destroying all the existing document views. If you overrode this function,
  please check that you don't rely on any views existing when it's called.

- wxGrid::FreezeTo() now asserts when passed invalid (out of range) number of
  rows or columns to freeze. But it also does freeze the requested rows/columns
  even if the grid is currently too small to show all of them or if there are
  no unfrozen rows/columns remaining.


Changes in behaviour which may result in build errors
-----------------------------------------------------

- Symbols deprecated in 3.0 are still available in this version but disabled by
  default, you need to set WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_3_0 to 1 to enable them. Symbols
  deprecated in 2.8 are not available any longer.

- wxMotif and wxGTK1 ports have been removed, please use wxWidgets 3.2 if you
  still need them.


3.3.0: (released 2022-??-??)
----------------------------

NOTE: In addition to the note below, also incorporate (either by
      copy or by reference) all the changes in the 3.2 branch (i.e.
      everything in this file after 3.2.0 in that branch).

NOTE: This file is updated only before the release, please use

    $ git log --notes=changelog --format='%N' v3.2.0..|grep .

      to see all the change log entries since the last release.

      To update the notes, fetch them first:

    $ git fetch origin refs/notes/changelog:refs/notes/changelog

      then use the following command to update them locally

    $ git notes --ref=changelog add -m 'wxPort: description.'

      and finally push it to the server.

    $ git push origin refs/notes/changelog:refs/notes/changelog

      If this fails due to a conflict because you had forgotten to
      run git-fetch first, you can always reset your local notes
      (LOSING YOUR CHANGES TO THEM, so make sure to make a copy)

    $ git fetch origin refs/notes/changelog
    $ git update-ref refs/notes/changelog FETCH_HEAD

      and then redo "git-notes add" and git-push.
