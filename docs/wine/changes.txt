20th June '99: wxWINE 2.1 snapshot 6 released

The numbering is just in synch with the wxGTK numbering as this
is actually the first ever release of wxWINE.

This snapshot just demonstrates that the complete build environment
for wxWINE is in place and that all that has to be done to get
wxWINE running is to make WINE work as Win32. No joke intended.
