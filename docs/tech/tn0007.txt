1. What you can do with the IDE files
=====================================

There are two IDE files. src\bc32.ide should help you to
create the wxWindows libraries from within the Ide of Borlands
C++, v. 5.x. Note that this doesn't include debugging code: you
need to change the settings if you wish to include debug
information. Previously, bc32d.ide was supplied with debug
settings, but this proved to time-consuming to maintain.

2. Where to install the files
=============================

You should copy the files for the libraries into the
src-directory of your wxWindows-Installation (e.g. C:\wxwin\src).
And the other file for the samples should be copied into the
samples-directory (e.g. C:\wxwin\samples).

(If installing from setup.exe or wx2..._bc.zip the files
will be installed into the appropriate directories
automatically).

3. How to modify them for your own needs
========================================

If your wxWindows-Installation resides on the same drive as your
Borland-Compiler and additionally the Borland-Installation is
the default (e.g. C:\BC5) then there should be no need to change
anything. Otherwise please change the path from within the ide
(Options->project->directories). Because we use the
$inherit-macro (Julian found the trick), this should work.

To add a new sample to samples\bc32.ide, follow these steps:

1. Choose Project->New target... and type in e.g.
   samples\newsample. Press OK.
2. Static, no OWL, MFC or class libraries. Check Multithread
   on. Press OK.
3. Right-click on the new node, choose Add node... and add
   ..\lib\wx32.lib and ..\lib\xpm.lib. Add any other source
   files you require.
4. Right-click on the new node, choose Edit Local Options.. and
   add in Directories, specify the following:

   Include: $inherit;.\newsample
   Library: $inherit;
   Source:  .\newsample
   Intermediate: .\newsample
   Final: .\newsample

4. How to create IDE files for your own wxWindows-programs
==========================================================

If you want to create an IDE file for your own wxWindows program,
please follow these steps.

1. Create a new project from the menu file->new->project.
2. Deactivate all the standard-options, the only three things
   that should be activated are "static" for the libraries,
   the checkbox OLE (you can leave this checkbox unchecked,
   but then you have to add the library \bc5\lib\ole2w32.lib
   to your project), and the Multithread checkbox.
3. Add the include-path of wxWindows to the include-path in the
   options-dialog (options->project->directories->include). The
   result should be something like:
   path_of_my_program;\bc5\include;\wxwin2\include;
4. Add the libraries to the project. Open the project-view and
   activate your program. Then right-click and choose "add" and
   select the wxWindows library (e.g. \wxwin\lib\wx32.lib). Also
   add the xpm library.
