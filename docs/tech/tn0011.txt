                 All about wxWidgets Version Numbers
                 ===================================

1. Where to update the version numbers:

   There are several places in the wxWidgets source tree that
   define the version number for the library.  When updating the
   version number all of these files must be edited:

   configure.in
   *.spec
   include/wx/version.h
   include/msvc/wx/setup.h [only major.minor used here]
   samples/minimal/borland_ide.cpp
   docs/doxygen/Doxyfile_inc (PROJECT_NUMBER)
   docs/doxygen/mainpages/manual.h (just date)
   docs/msw/install.txt {major release only}
   docs/changes.txt
   build/bakefiles/version.bkl {C:R:A}
   build/script/win_docs.bat {windows doc and setup file}
   distrib/scripts/build-environ.cfg {SVN tar and zip files}
   include/wx/osx/config_xcode.h

   The script misc/scripts/inc_release can be used for incrementing
   the release field of the version, i.e. changing 2.8.x to 2.8.x+1.
