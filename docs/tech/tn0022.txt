                        Making a new wxWidgets release
                        ==============================

Before making the release
-------------------------

Update docs/readme.txt. Please review its contents in addition to just
changing the version number.


Creating release files
----------------------

Currently our release system uses a Python 2.x script to generate releases.
The script requires Unix utilities such as tar, zip and unix2dos and thus must
be run either on Unix or using Cygwin on Windows. To generate a release, simply
run the following command:

build/tools/create-archive.py --compression=all /path/to/output/dir

This will produce zip, gzip and bzip archives of the tree (without
"compression" argument only .gz is made). Note that this commands produces huge
amounts of output so redirecting it to a file is recommended.

To add a prefix to the release, such as RC1, the SVN revision, or a date, just
pass --postfix="postfix" to the script. More info on the options and their
possible values can be found by calling `create-archive.py --help`.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You *must* run this script from a clean source tree, that is,
          with no junk files in it or modifications. This is because the
          release should be a pristine copy of the tree as of the time of
          release. If you have legitimate modifications in the tree that need
          to be in the release, commit them first.


Alternative non official release scripts
----------------------------------------

If you use git-svn, then you can use alternative script that avoids the
problems such as using non-clean tree and also has better handling of the ends
of lines conversions. To use it you need to run

- build/tools/svn-find-native-eols.pl
- build/tools/git-make-release
- build/tools/make-html-docs

(the last one can also be used without git).


Uploading
---------

Upload the files to SourceForge (the simplest is to scp them to
sfusername,wxwindows@frs.sf.net:/home/frs/project/w/wx/wxwindows/x.y.z) and to
ftp.wxwidgets.org (ask Chris to do it).

Create http://docs.wxwidgets.org/x.y.z/ (ask Bryan to do it if not done yet).


Announcement
------------

Post announcement at least to wx-announce@googlegroups.com.

TODO: where else to announce it?

Update www.wxwidgets.org, usually a news item is enough but something more can
be called for for major releases.

Post to wxBlog if necessary.


Version updates
---------------

Trac: mark the milestone corresponding to the release as completed and add a
new version for it to allow reporting bugs against it (ask Vadim or Robin to do
it).

Run misc/scripts/inc_release to increment micro version, i.e. replace x.y.z
with x.y.z+1 (minor or major versions updates require manual intervention).
