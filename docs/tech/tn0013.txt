                      How to prepare wxGTK distribution
                      =================================

0. Introduction
---------------

This note explains what should be done, step by step, to prepare the packages
for a wxGTK distribution. Note that the same instructions should be used for
the other Unix-based ports including wxMotif, wxX11 and wxBase.

See distrib/msw/makerpm for a script that embodies some of the steps
below.

1. Preparing the sources
------------------------

a) Do a fresh checkout using the command

   cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.wxwidgets.org:/packs/cvsroots/wxwidgets co wxGTK

   NB: if you realize later that some needed files were not checked out
       by this command, please modify CVSROOT/modules to include the missing
       files so that it works for the next release!

   You also need the samples, demos and contrib directories, so change to
   wxWidgets directory created by the first cvs command and do "cvs up -d"
   for each of them. Of course, you can also check out everything (use
   wxWidgets module name instead of wxGTK) if the bandwidth and disk space
   are not a problem.

b) Create a build directory under wxWidgets, e.g. I use "gtk-release",
   "cd" to it and run configure: the options don't really matter, you can use
   something like

       ../configure -C --without-subdirs

   to make it run a bit faster.

c) Then type "make -j1 dist bzip-dist-only". This should create the
   following files;

   wxGTK-${version}.tar.bz2
   wxGTK-demos-${version}.tar.bz2
   wxGTK-samples-${version}.tar.bz2
   wxGTK-${version}.tar.gz
   wxGTK-demos-${version}.tar.gz
   wxGTK-samples-${version}.tar.gz

   where version is something like 2.3.2.

   Note 1: "-j1" is needed now because make dist target is broken and doesn't
           allow parallelizing, if your make is aliased to "make -j4" (like
           mine), it simply won't work.

   Note 2: there are also dist-only and bzip-dist targets, the "-only" suffix
           means to just create the archive supposing that the files
           themselves are already under _dist_dir/wxGTK-${version} where
           "make dist" creates them

2. Building the RPMs
--------------------

Note that we didn't check if the library actually could be built -- this is
because it is done during this step, during the RPM generation. If, for
whatever reason, you don't build the RPMs, you must have checked previously
that the library could be built -- nothing worse than a release which doesn't
even compile!

The rest of this section applies to a system with RPM installed (Redhat in my
case).

a) Setting up the RPM tree: you should have the RPM tree set up properly
   before doing anything else. If you are going to build the RPMs as root,
   you already have one under /usr/src/redhat and can just build there.
   Otherwise you may do it (without root rights) in any directory RPM_ROOT.
   RPM_ROOT should have the following subdirectories: BUILD, RPMS, SOURCES,
   SPECS and SRPMS. RPMS should contain i386, i686 and noarch. You should
   also create the file ~/.rpmmacros containing at least a line like this:
   "%_topdir /biton/zeitlin/rpm" (replace the directory with $RPM_ROOT, of
   course)

   In either case, put the file wxGTK-${version}.tar.bz2 in SOURCES
   subdirectory and wxGTK.spec in SPECS one (hint: you can just link them from
   there -- like this you won't forget to update them after redoing "make
   dist").

b) Start RPM build by going to RPM_ROOT directory and typing "rpm -ba
   SPECS/wxGTK.spec". It may be a good idea to append "2>&1 | tee wxGTK.out"
   (or "|& tee" if you're using the one true shell ;-) as it might be not
   easy to detect errors in the verbose rpm output if anything goes wrong.

   Then wait (and pray that nothing goes wrong because if anything does
   you'll have to restart from the very beginning because rpm doesn't allow
   to short circuit the package generation).

   If everything goes well, this should produce many files in SRPMS and
   RPMS/i386 subdirectories.

   Use "rpm -ba --with gtk2" to build GTK+2 version of wxGTK and use
   "rpm -ba --with gtk2 --with unicode" to build GTK+2 Unicode build
   (these are defaults, you can use --without option to change this).

   Note: you may want to set the environment variable SMP to 3 or 4 on an
         SMP machine to speed up the build (it uses "make -j$SMP" if the
         variable is set)

c) Test the resulting RPMs: install them using "rpm -i" (or "rpm -U) as usual
   and try to build some samples using makefile.unx ("make -f makefile.unx")
   so that they use wx-config in the PATH and not from the build tree

3. Building the DEBs
--------------------

This is explained in more details in debian/README.HowToBuild.txt.


4. Uploading the files
----------------------

All 11 files should be uploaded (via FTP) to several locations.

a) incoming.sourceforge.net, go to project admin page on sf.net and choose
   add/edit releases for more details

b) ftp://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/pub (Julian has the password)

5. Announcing the release
-------------------------

a) FreshMeat:
   - http://freshmeat.net/projects/wxwidgetsgtk/
   - username and password are "wxgtk" for logging in
   - hit "new release" at the top
   - follow the step by step

b) wx-announce mailing list: mailto:wx-announce@lists.wxwidgets.org

   The standard announcement text is in docs/publicity/announce.txt

c) update www.wxwidgets.org

d) GNOME (very effective, stays on front page for days):
    - http://www.gnome.org/applist
    - Search for wxWidgets
    - Update the version number
    - Ignore the error message

e) MacNN:

h) LinuxDevices.com:
    Interesting for wxUniversal.
