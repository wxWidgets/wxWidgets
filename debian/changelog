  * Added icons and *.desktop files for the wpython-wxtools

 -- Robin Dunn <robin@alldunn.com>  Thu,  4 May 2006 15:35:08 -0700

wxwidgets2.6 (2.6.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Next try for an upload candidate.
  * Fixes FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD. Closes: #327638
  * Update fr.po, thanks to Thomas Huriaux and debian-l10n-french.
    Closes: #328966
  * Split wxbase back into its own package, after all these years
    and just after I drop it, someone finally has a use for it.
    Such is life.  Closes: #333944
  * Fixes FTBFS with new make.  If this ugly quoting is the tradeoff,
    I'm itching to learn of the fabulous benefits...
    Ack NMU for this from Kurt Roeckx to keep the amd64 transition
    rolling while my x86 build machine was painfully dying.  Thanks!
    Closes: #350695, #361443
  * New FSF address in copyright file.
  * Add an index.html link to the doc contents page.  Closes: #328896
  * Fixes declarations for friends, as required by C++, and now gcc4.1.
    Closes: #358219

    by Richard Esplin.  Closes: #342761
  * Disable the reserved vtable entries (again, but this time its
    optional) to retain compatibility with the existing release
    in the distro.
  * Update build-deps for xorg7.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Apr 2006 16:50:24 +0930

wxwidgets2.6 (2.6.1.2-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Make it build using the new make.  Patch from
    Daniel Schepler <schepler@math.berkeley.edu> (Closes: #350695)

 -- Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>  Sun,  9 Apr 2006 14:04:34 +0200

wxwidgets2.6 (2.6.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the build_options.py created by the in tree build.
    Closes: #324960  Thanks.
  * Move the wx.pth alternative to its own directory where
    it can't mess with anything else.
  * Pull in changes to dcclient.cpp and window.cpp from HEAD
    mostly for gtk2.8 compatibility, but fixes a couple of
    other issues too.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Aug 2005 18:38:31 +0930

wxwidgets2.6 (2.6.1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reshuffle the wxPython packages again, to comply better with
    the python naming policy and improve support for concurrent
    installations.  The runtime files are now in python-wxgtk2.6-0,
    the version selector in python-wxversion and the ancillary
    tools in the python-wxtools package.

    Many thanks to Matthias Klose <doko@ubuntu.com> for patches
    and patient prodding to get wxpython into better shape for
    version transitions.

  * Collapse the wx-common package into an 'unversioned' one also.

  * On its way back into unstable by popular demand.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Aug 2005 21:25:34 +0930

wxwidgets2.6 (2.6.1.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * 2.6.2 prerelease test -- Pain for the Impatient.

    Be warned, wx2.6 has still not branched off the main
    development tree, and the API is still in flux.

    This one is to see what else is wrong.

  * Upload to experimental now the -c2 transition is real.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Jun 2005 14:08:33 +0930

wxwidgets2.6 (2.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * 8 ... 9 ... 10.  Here it comes, ready or not...
  * make install includes archive.h now.  Closes: #294998

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Apr 2005 01:15:05 +0930

wxwidgets2.5 (2.5.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Last chance.
  * Conflict with wxwin2.4-i18n.  Due to inertia, it really
    does.  Sorry if you are not a gringo and want both 2.4 and
    2.5 apps localised on the same machine.  Maybe for 2.6.1.
    Bitch upstream if you want it fixed.
  * Don't package the static libs anymore for wxGTK.
    Blame drepper for encouraging their obsolescence  If you dare.
  * Trim the configure options to reflect the new defaults.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Apr 2005 22:43:58 +0930

wxwidgets2.5 (2.5.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Experimental snapshot.
  * More bakefile bogosity manually patched.  Closes: #294998
  * Fix stray conflicts with 2.4.  Closes: #287623
  * Fixes lack of version checking in wxPython examples.
    Closes: #287772
  * Fixes FTBFS on ppc.  Closes: #285186
  * Enable gnomeprint, Closes: #284943 satisfactorily I hope.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Feb 2005 16:52:38 +1030

wxwidgets2.5 (2.5.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Experimental snapshot.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Feb 2005 12:30:45 +1030

wxwidgets2.5 (2.5.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This time, really now.
    A snapshot that is actually ready for wider release.
    Thanks to all who've been patient.  We know who you are.
  * Update path to wxPython site-packages, build them with
    --no_rpath since we will install the in tree build.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Nov 2004 11:01:00 +1030

wxwidgets2.5 (2.5.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Functioning concurrent installs for both the C++ libs
    and wxPython along with legacy support for existing 2.4
    users mean we can now safely introduce this release to
    unstable without an adverse effect on existing users.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Oct 2004 15:54:46 +1030

wxwidgets2.5 (2.5.3.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Experimental prerelease.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Sep 2004 03:29:56 +0930

wxwidgets2.5 (2.5.2.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Greatly improved concurrent installs.  We can now install
    a much wider range of builds without conflicting and select
    between them without the need to go changing symlinks or
    the suite of applications you have installed.
  * Contrib is dead.  Long live contrib.
    Better multi-library builds have made contrib more or less
    obsolete.  This is the big crunch before the boom.  Everything
    useful out of contrib has been moved back into the main package.
    Later we will split many out again along the lines of shared
    dependencies, so a minimal wx install really can remain minimal
    without losing any future potential.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Sep 2004 00:59:01 +0930

wxwidgets2.5 (2.5.1.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The s/ndow/dget/g release.
  * Yes, the name has changed and the terrorists have won again.
    Having a name too similar to Lindows apparently makes us a
    liability to the illusion their assailants will want to project
    in court.  Eleven or so years of unbroken, unquestioned usage
    was not nearly so interesting to these people as the fact we
    were a soft target and easy to deprive of due process.
  * wxGTK is now built with gtk2 and unicode support.
  * wxBase is no longer a separate package, it is built with the
    GUI libs which now depend on it.  We might split it out again
    one day if there is a need for that.
  * Added support for GNU/K*BSD (thanks again to Robert Millan).
  * Non-core functionality is now provided by separate libraries
    rather than simply being built into a single behemoth unit.
    Of course, given the way these things work, almost none of
    them are actually smaller, and the load time is unlikely to
    improve either, but the logical separation may be beneficial.
  * Removed many elements of the build scripts that are no longer
    required due to improvements and changes elsewhere.
  * Added README.examples for people who think these are packaged
    as demos instead of as extended documentation.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Feb 2004 17:00:29 +1030

wxwindows2.5 (2.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New beginnings.  Back to development flavored chaos again.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Dec 2002 01:08:50 -0800

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.2.6) unstable; urgency=high

  * High urgency so as not to reset the shotclock for getting wx and
    its deps moving into testing.  All changes since the last release
    are superficial.
  * Reapply HURD/K*BSD patch fragment that should not have been reverted.
    Closes: #217726    (Make a wish, the third time is lucky so I'm told.)
  * Updated .po files.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Aug 2004 14:50:07 +0930

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.2.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Medium urgency to keep things moving for the libtiff fudge.
  * Switch to dhv4, libtiff4.
  * Fix menu quoting.
  * Whittled down on some of the build config scripts that weren't
    really earning their weight.
  * Check for DISTCC_HOSTS and set the number of make -j jobs according
    to the number of hosts it contains.
  * Purge the .pyc from site-packages/wx too.  They are generated on
    site at install time.
  * Includes type correctness fix for 64bit arch's.  Closes: #197661
  * Merged patches from Robert Millan for HURD/K*BSD support back from
    cvs head.  Closes: #217726
  * Store the python version we preconfigure virgin source with, then
    people don't need the default python package installed to build
    from source, just the packages declared in the build-deps.  Fix
    the -python postinst to use this when byte compiling too.
    Closes: #259128  (and fixes #258529)
  * Added README.examples to explain that these examples are extended
    documentation for coders, rather than trial apps for users.
    Closes: #212894
  * Dropped the examples from the demos subdir, the samples cover a lot
    more ground than they used to and are generally more up to date,
    it's also no longer hard to find a broad range of real applications
    with source.  Provided more external pointers in the README.
    Closes: #258530 after discussion with the submitter.  This is a bit
    less c++ for your python, but I'm not convinced yet that either half
    is such a burden on the other as to warrant an extra package here
    at this stage.
  * Fix linking of wxgtk_gl to include the proper dependency on wxgtk.
    Remove suggestion of libgl1, by declaring the full library dependency
    we now automatically insist on it.  Closes: #262027
  * Include wxrc and wxrcedit in contrib-dev.  Added a simple man page
    and a menu entry for wxrcedit.  Closes: #261811
  * Update gl sample makefiles to use --gl-libs.  Thanks to Rich Walker
    for picking this up.  Closes: #246169
  * Enable the building of a libwxgtk-dbg-python package, but do not
    build and upload it by default at this stage.  Closes: #220568
  * Does not fix #239782, sorry.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Jul 2004 03:21:42 +0930

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified build scripts to use pythonX.Y instead of python(>=X.Y)
  * Removed bogus hard coded python2.2-xml.  Closes: #216182
  * Enabled iostream support despite my opinion of this c++ 'feature'.
    Closes: #211050
  * Event handling for menus with bitmaps fixed.  Closes: #214788
  * Includes fixes for wxHTTP and wxURL parsing. Closes: #211023, #213600

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Oct 2003 13:48:07 +0930

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New stable release.  Closes: #198622
  * Ack python NMU changes, Thanks Josselin!
  * Hurd support added to configure.  Closes: #191581
  * Fixes ctrl-tab problem with pyslsk.  Closes: #187923
  * Fixed configure for autoconf 2.57-3.  Closes: #190755
  * Added conflict/replace for -doc.  Closes: #202242

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Aug 2003 15:59:12 +0930

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.0.8-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU for python transition.
  * Build-depend and depend on python 2.3 (closes: #204737).

 -- Josselin Mouette <joss@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Aug 2003 22:21:48 +0200

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated package sections to suit the new taxonomy.
  * No public release of this version.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2003 20:13:39 -0700

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I wish people would read the existing discussion about new releases
    before posting 'reminder' bugs" release.  Closes: #189144
  * Moved back to using png2.  gtk1 forces that on anything using it and
    gtk2 support is still too flakey both in wx and dependent apps for
    us to entertain it in a stable release.  This is a *really* messed
    up situation for anyone trying to maintain a development machine.
    Thank the png and gtk theme people if its a pain in your ass too.
    Closes: #186779
  * Add real package options to the gl build deps.  Closes: #182210
  * Really fix the XRCed problem, unlike 2.4.0.7 ; ) Closes: #183712

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Apr 2003 18:42:54 -0700

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Conflict to Replaces so people can use 2.4 -dev before all
    their 2.3 deps are gone.  Closes: #178305
  * Added wxPy supplied 2.3 distutils to the source package, apparently the
    standard 2.2 one is now insufficient.  This hopefully Closes: #178457

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 2003 17:36:59 -0800

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing quantize.h to install.  Closes: #178135
  * Removed unnecessary -dev deps.
  * move wxwin.m4 &c out of the runtime package and conflict with earlier
    versions that didn't.  Also nuke some empty dir cruft that slipped by.
    Thanks for noticing the latter Josip.  Closes: #176033
  * dinstall won't close bugs from earlier unreleased versions :(
    see below for explanations.  Closes: #162948, #171258, #168148
    Closes: #170748, #168250, #164557, #172390, #172447, #168887
    Closes: #155476, #155478

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jan 2003 16:46:31 -0800

wxwindows2.4 (2.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The fingers crossed release.
  * de.po typo fix.  Closes: #174084
  * tr.po stable tree patch.  Closes: #174667
  * Add a manpage for the wxPython scripts pointing to the pydoc docs.
  * Disabled generation of gtk-univ, it is a rather insensible combination
    now and should be replaced by x11-univ instead.
  * There had to be some payoff to all the delays -- a clean gcc3.2
    transition :-)  This package certainly obsoletes 2.3.3.2 and I'll
    be seeking to finally have 2.2.9.2 removed as well once Audacity
    is updated.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Dec 2002 00:50:48 -0800

wxwindows2.3 (2.3.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * 2.4.0pre1 I guess.
  * Added -ffunction-sections for broken hppa linker. Closes: #162948
  * Conflict/Replace wxPython2.2.  Since its nmu these two packages
    can no longer currently coexist.  Closes: #171258
  * xrced.py path search fixed.  Closes: #168148, #170748
  * Actually install all wxUniv headers to the header package.
    Closes: #168250, #164557
  * Robin tells me this one should be fixed in 2.3 too, I can't confirm
    so please reopen if it's not.  Closes: #172390
  * Added menu items for pycrust/pyshell, thanks Martin.  Closes: #172447
  * Broken header fixed.  Closes: #168887

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Nov 2002 18:54:21 -0800

wxwindows2.3 (2.3.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The one more for luck release.
  * Debian-wise, it fixes the problem with contrib lib name clashes;
    code-wise, lots of little issues (and a couple of big 'uns) from
    2.3.3 -- see the more regular change or cvs logs for details...
  * Yes, it's still the unstable branch, yes the request for testing
    to see if we can reasonably obsolete 2.2 in post-woody debian
    is still current, and yes we're still working toward a stable
    2.4 release as fast as we can.   Big thanks to everyone who's
    been patient and/or active fixing things.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Sep 2002 17:43:05 -0700

wxwindows2.3 (2.3.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ok, Robin says wxPython is good to go.
  * Since wx2.2 has crashed and burned with the new releases of
    python and png, Could package maintainers with packages that
    depend on wx please recompile with this package and let me
    know if they still need 2.2 in woody?   If not I'll have them
    removed.  There should be a 2.4 release following very soon.
    (hah, let's see how the date on that comment testifies!)
  * Yes, I know wxpython is missing man pages for some of its
    scripts.  File a bug if you must, but preferably, if you know
    what they do, attach a patch containing one.  I don't use them
    myself or could even do more than guess what they do today.
    Sorry, C++.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Sep 2002 16:25:12 -0700

wxwindows2.3 (2.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "If it sucks, You whined for it!" release.
  * It's also STILL our unstable branch, so I'll probably summarily
    close any bugs related to that fact.  Please report bugs in
    the code to wx-dev@lists.wxwindows.org (or the wx bug tracker on
    SourceForge) and not the debian BTS.  They'll get to the right
    people much faster that way.  Packaging bugs to the BTS per normal.
    Thanks!
    Closes: #155476, #155478
  * New dynamic library/object loading code.
  * Fixes several showstoppers from 2.3.2
  * wxPython now built with python2.2
  * Depend explicitly on libpng3-dev, hopefully that will stay the
    right thing a little longer.  Closes: #143439
  * Various wxPython issues all likely to be entirely different in 2.3
    Please reopen (and/or tell Robin :) if they aren't fixed.
    Closes: #153276, #124372, #146757, #148062, #146303
  * Broken package managers are not my problem, unless enough people
    think so to make it policy.  Autogenerated bugs for things like
    this suck too, just btw.  If you're going to autogenerate menial
    labor for people, at least autogenerate a patch to go along with
    it.  Closes: #130971, #130989, #130992

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Dec 2001 15:41:31 -0800

wxwindows2.3 (2.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major Overhaul.  First serious release contender.

      Added experimental -univ(gtk) package.
      Switched to python 2.1

wxwindows2.2 (2.2.9.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix wxPython gl bug.  Closes: #130758
  * Add versioned build dep on the -dev package too
    to help avoid the 'png fiasco' for packages built
    with wx.  (Thanks Joshua)  Closes: #131355

wxwindows2.2 (2.2.9) unstable; urgency=high

  * fix for arches with unsigned char as default.
  * high urgency because this fix really should get
    into woody.
    Closes: #127014

wxwindows2.2 (2.2.8.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add wxSIZE_T_IS defines to setup.h
    Add automate that to my TODO list.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Nov 2001 05:55:47 -0800

wxwindows2.2 (2.2.8.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put the (modified) size_t == ulong kludge back into sndwav.cpp
    it's still needed until wxDataOutputStream is made 64 bit
    friendly, which may not happen for 2.2 since it will probably
    not be binary compatible.
  * caps a memory leak in the jpeg handler.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Nov 2001 11:53:59 -0800

wxwindows2.2 (2.2.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backported size_t test from 2.3 tree, removes the need for
    specific tests for various 64 bit platforms including now
    S/390 (thanks to Gerhard Tonn for the report).
    Closes: #120768

wxwindows2.2 (2.2.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed bogus samples makefile. Closes: #110061
  * Added ability to build wxMSW-cross packages, but they
    are not built and distributed by default.

    cleaned configure.in and removed the need for a common setup.h,
    removed superfluous library links and generally tweaked things
    so as to make adding new ports easier.
  * added --gl-libs flag to wx-config.
  * added wx2.4 forward compatible event macros.
  * added build fixes for IA64 from Jeff Licquia, and fixed clean
    rules to pick up unnoticed strays that effected NMU builds.
    Thanks Jeff.  Closes: #101734, #104679  (fixed in NMU)
  * Medium urgency since several other packages are waiting
    for this to get into testing.

wxwindows2.2 (2.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * wxWin 2.2.1 stable release.
  * First upload to deb.org after repackaging to build directly from
    upstream cvs.
  * still not quite lintian clean yet:
    - wxPython lib can't be built with a proper soname yet.
    - the -dbg packages need an override for the shlib symlink.
    - and a couple of packages have the lib symlink 'before the
      lib', but that's ugly to fix right now, they aren't critical
      libs, and allegedly this will be handled by dpkg sometime soon.
  * moved full licence text into copyright file.
