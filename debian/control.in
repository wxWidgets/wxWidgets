Description: wxBase library (runtime) - non-GUI support classes of wxWindows toolkit
 wxBase is a collection of C++ classes providing basic data structures
 (strings, lists, arrays), powerful wxDateTime class for date manipulations,
 portable wrappers around many OS-specific functions allowing to build the
 same program under all supported folders, wxThread class for writing
 multithreaded programs using either Win32 or POSIX threads and much more.
 wxBase currently supports the following platforms: Generic Unix (Linux, FreeBSD,
 Solaris, HP-UX, ...), win32, and BeOS.
 .
 This package is only useful for non-gui apps.  It offers a subset of the
 classes in libwx_gtk=V for use in console apps and daemons.  It is currently
 under development and may not be as stable as the gui version.

Description: wxBase library (debug) - non-GUI support classes of wxWindows toolkit
 wxBase is a collection of C++ classes providing basic data structures
 (strings, lists, arrays), powerful wxDateTime class for date manipulations,
 portable wrappers around many OS-specific functions allowing to build the
 same program under all supported folders, wxThread class for writing
 multithreaded programs using either Win32 or POSIX threads and much more.
 wxBase currently supports the following platforms: Generic Unix (Linux, FreeBSD,
 Solaris, HP-UX, ...) win32, and BeOS.

 This package provides a debug version of the wxBase library.  It is compiled
 both with -g for normal debugger tracing and with the __WXDEBUG__ flag which
 provides many internal checks by wxWindows itself that are not performed on
 apps compiled with the 'release version' libs in the -dev package.
