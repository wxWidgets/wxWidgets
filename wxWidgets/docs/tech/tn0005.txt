                     Adding a wxWidgets contribution
                     ===============================

Here are some different kinds of contribution:

1. Bug fixes. You can send these to the wx-dev list.
2. New classes. New classes normally go in the contrib hierarchy:
   please see below for more details. They may be promoted to
   the main wxWidgets hierarchy if they are deemed to be 'core'.
3. A utility application, such as a new dialog editor or
   file format conversion utility. If adding to the CVS
   archive, you may put it under the utils hierarchy,
   preferably with further src and docs directories.

You may or may not wish to add your code to the main wxWidgets CVS
archive. Whether your code is appropriate for this archive
should first be ascertained by discussing it on wx-dev@wxwidgets.org.

The contrib hierarchy
---------------------

When contributing a new class or set of classes, please
organise your files in the following hierarchy, so that
when a user unarchives your contribution, it
slots neatly into the existing source hierarchy.
It also simplifies compilation for users, since wxWidgets
makefiles and project files are set up to search in
contrib/include/wx and contrib/lib. For example, to
include yourclass.h, the following directive is used:

#include "wx/yourclass/yourclass.h"

Here are the directories:

contrib/include/wx/yourclass/           ; Your header(s) go here
contrib/src/yourclass/                  ; Your source file(s) go here
contrib/samples/yourclass/              ; Your sample(s) go here
contrib/docs/latex/yourclass/           ; Your Latex doc sources go here
contrib/docs/html/yourclass/            ; Your HTML doc files go here
contrib/docs/htmlhelp/yourclass/        ; Your MS HTML Help doc files go here
contrib/docs/htb/yourclass/             ; Your wxHTML doc files go here
contrib/docs/pdf/yourclass/             ; Your PDF doc files go here
contrib/docs/winhelp/yourclass/         ; Your WinHelp doc files go here
contrib/build/yourclass/                ; Your makefiles

It is recommended that you produce a manual using Tex2RTF, as specified
in Technical Note TN0003. This allows you to output all the above
formats, though for PDF you will need Latex and Ghostscript or
Word and Adobe Acrobat, and for MS HTML Help and WinHelp you need
the appropriate (freely available) help compilers.

Your binary library files can go in the main lib directory or contrib/lib,
but the main lib directory is recommended.

Please include a readme.txt in your source directory, and conform
as much as possible to the coding guidelines specified on the web
site in the 'Backroom' section. Include bakefile and generated makefiles
(see Technote #16 for details).

Your archive can be in .tgz or .zip format. For inclusion on
the wxWidgets ftp site and CD-ROM, please send your submission to
Julian Smart <julian@wxwidgets.org> as a binary attachment.
An entry will be added to the Contributions web page.
