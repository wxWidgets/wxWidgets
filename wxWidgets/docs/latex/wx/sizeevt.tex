\section{\class{wxSizeEvent}}\label{wxsizeevent}

A size event holds information about size change events.

The EVT\_SIZE handler function will be called when the window has been resized.

You may wish to use this for frames to resize their child windows as appropriate.

Note that the size passed is of
the whole window: call \helpref{wxWindow::GetClientSize}{wxwindowgetclientsize} for the area which may be
used by the application.

When a window is resized, usually only a small part of the window is damaged and you
may only need to repaint that area. However, if your drawing depends on the size of the window,
you may need to clear the DC explicitly and repaint the whole window. In which case, you
may need to call \helpref{wxWindow::Refresh}{wxwindowrefresh} to invalidate the entire window.

To process a size event, use this event handler macro to direct input to a member
function that takes a wxSizeEvent argument.
