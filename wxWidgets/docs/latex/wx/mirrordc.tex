\section{\class{wxMirrorDC}}\label{wxmirrordc}

wxMirrorDC is a simple wrapper class which is always associated with a real 
\helpref{wxDC}{wxdc} object and either forwards all of its operations to it
without changes (no mirroring takes place) or exchanges {\it x} and {\it y} 
coordinates which makes it possible to reuse the same code to draw a figure and
its mirror -- i.e. reflection related to the diagonal line $x == y$.

wxMirrorDC has been added in wxWidgets version 2.5.0.

\func{}{wxMirrorDC}{\param{wxDC\& }{dc}, \param{bool }{mirror}}

Creates a (maybe) mirrored DC associated with the real \arg{dc}. Everything
drawn on wxMirrorDC will appear (and maybe mirrored) on \arg{dc}.

\arg{mirror} specifies if we do mirror (if it is \true) or not (if it is 
\false).
