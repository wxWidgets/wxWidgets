\section{\class{wxTreebookEvent}}\label{wxtreebookevent}

This class represents the events generated by a treebook control: currently,
there are four of them. The PAGE\_CHANGING and PAGE\_CHANGED - have exactly the same
behaviour as \helpref{wxNotebookEvent}{wxnotebookevent}.

The other two NODE\_COLLAPSED and NODE\_EXPANDED are triggered when page node in the tree control
is collapsed/expanded. The page index could be retreived by calling
\helpref{wxTreebookEvent::GetSelection}{wxtreebookeventgetselection}.
