#
# NOTE1:
#  This apspec provides wxGTK locales and compiled libraries only;
#  it does not provide headers nor wx-config since this package is not
#  targeted to developers but rather end-users of wx-based applications.
#  Also, making a -devel autopackage wouldn't be very useful given the
#  big number of possible configurations for building wxWidgets...
#
# NOTE2:
#  This wxGTK autopackage contains wx libraries built in
#  Unicode, shared, multilib, release mode.
#  This is because:
#  1) UNICODE is better than ansi
#  2) Autopackages of a library only have sense when shipping with SHARED libraries
#  3) MULTILIB builds of wxWidgets are the default and suggested build mode
#  4) Released applications should use RELEASE builds of wxWidgets not debug ones!

# For info why we give --enable-unicode --enable-shared --disable-debug options see note2 at beginning
# of this file.
# The --disable-dependency-tracking --disable-precomp-headers are because these things confuse apgcc.
# The --with-libtiff=builtin --with-expat=builtin are because we want wxWidgets not to use the system's
# version of these libraries: tiff has recently broken its ABI and must be linked statically, expat is
# not always available.

[Imports]

# remove stuff useless to final binary users: headers, wxwin.m4 and bakefile presets
rm -rf include share/aclocal share/bakefile

# this imports also some symlink which won't be used...
# anyway symlinks give no problems since they won't be installed so it's not necessary
# to complicate this section to exclude them...
bash
echo '*' | import


[Prepare]
# GTK+2 is the only requirement
require @gtk.org/gtk 2.0


[Install]
# install wxrc-$SOFTWAREVERSION and its symbolic link
installExe bin/wxrc*

# install shared libraries (not symlinks - they are recreated by installLib!)

# install wx's things which goes in lib\ but are not libraries
