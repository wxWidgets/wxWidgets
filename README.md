wxWidgets is a free and open source cross-platform C++ framework
for writing advanced GUI applications using native controls.

wxWidgets allows you to write native-looking GUI applications for
all the major desktop platforms and also helps with abstracting
the differences in the non-GUI aspects between them. It is free
for the use in both open source and commercial applications, comes
with the full, easy to read and modify, source and extensive
documentation and a collection of more than a hundred examples.
