Building Projects
-----------------

makeprojects is an AppleScript that uses the XML Tools from 
http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/XMLTools2/

the reason for this script is to support a single place of definition for the files needed
for a certain platform by building Xcode projects from the bakefiles files.bkl file list.

it creates new projects from the ..._in.xcodeproj templates in this folder and then
reads in the files lists from the files.bkl in the build/bakefiles directory, evaluates the
conditions in these definitions and then adds the correct files to the newly created Xcode
projects

if you only need a specific target and not all three of them (carbon, cocoa, iphone) then you can 
comment the unneeded makeProject calls.

Prerequisites
-------------

you need the xml scripting additions from latenightsw,
