#!/bin/sh
#
# This is the script used by VZ to make wxWidgets releases. It is unofficial
# because it must be ran from git-svn repository and not the official svn one
# and relies on having a recent Perl installation. But it has the advantage of
# being very simple because git knows which files should be included in the
# distribution and we don't need to maintain the list of them ourselves but we
# also don't run the risk of including anything unwanted.
#
# Another prerequisite for using it is to create the list of files to be
# converted to DOS EOLs for Windows distribution, it must exist in the parent
# directory and be called eol-native. This can be done using the companion
# svn-find-native-eols.pl script. And will only need to be redone when
# svn:eol-style property changes for any files (most likely because it will be
# set for a newly added file).
#
# To summarize, here are the steps to create the release:
#
#   % cd $svn
#   % $git/build/tools/svn-find-native-eols.pl > $git/../eol-native
#   % cd $git
#   % git svn tag WX_x_y_z
#   % ./build/tools/git-make-release x.y.z
#   % ... upload ../wxWidgets-x.y.z.{7z,tar.bz2,zip} ...
#
# If anything is wrong and some minor fixes are required, only the last two
# steps (tagging and git-make-release) must be repeated.
