    There is one xml file such as this per build slave containing a <build>
    element for each build the slave runs. Each <build> corresponds to a
    column in the waterfall display.

    For full documentation see:

<!--
    Notes:

    The elements marked 'Unique' below must be unique across all builds on
    all slaves.

    If a build is currently failing because of something other than a bug in
    wxWidgets, e.g. out of space or missing libs, then comment it out, or
    add '** Ignore **' to the beginning of the <name>, so that wxWidgets
    developers know not to waste time investigating.
-->
<build>
    <!--
        Unique. Appears as the title in the waterfall display.
    -->
    <name>Linux x86_64 wxGTK Stable</name>

    <!--
        Unique. The name of a directory for the bulid.
    -->
    <builddir>example_gtk</builddir>

    <!--
        The name of a scheduler that will trigger this build. common.xml
        currently defines:

        * 'trunk_quick' and 'stable_quick'. These trigger a build after
          every source change on the trunk and stable branches respectively.

        * Weekly schedulers that fire once a week. There is one of these
          for every half hour of the week, e.g. you have monday_0600,
          monday_0630, etc..

        * Daily schedulers that fire once a day. There is also one of these
          for every half hour, e.g. daily_0600, daily_0630, etc..

        An empty <scheduler/> element takes its value from the previous build
        incremented in the following way:

        * Weekly schedulers are incremented by a day, monday_0600 becomes
          tuesday_0600, and at the end of the week the time is also bumped by
          an hour, saturday_0600 becomes sunday_0700.

        * Daily scheduler are incremented by an hour.

        The <scheduler> element can be omitted, in which case the build
        never runs automatically, but can still be triggered manually.
        Or you can use several, e.g. you could use two weekly schedulers
        that fire on different days to have a build run twice a week.
    -->
    <scheduler>monday_0600</scheduler>

    <!--
        The meaning of <sandbox> is specific to the build slave. There
        should be a comment in the slave's configuration file saying if they
        are allowed or required. On the testdrive it specifies the remote
        machine that will run the bulid.
    -->
    <sandbox>debug</sandbox>

    <!--
        You can override the make command the compile steps will use using
        this <make> element, if omitted defaults to 'make'. For Windows
        builds this becomes the place to put build options as there is no
        configure step.
    -->
    <make>nmake -f makefile.vc SHARED=1 CPPUNIT_CFLAGS=-I\cppunit\include CPPUNIT_LIBS=cppunit.lib</make>

        The build steps.

    <steps>
        <!--
            Check out the sources, by default the trunk branch. Or for a
            particular branch or tag, e.g.:
                <checkout branch="{$STABLE_BRANCH}"/>
                <checkout branch="branches/WX_2_6_BRANCH"/>
        -->
        <checkout/>

        <!--
            A <shellcommand> build step can be used anywhere you need to run
            arbitrary commands not covered by the standard build steps.
            <haltOnFailure/> specifies that the whole build fails if this
            step fails, without it it continues with the next step anyway.
        -->
        <shellcommand>
            <description>setting up</description>

        <!--
            Configure. Options and environment variables can be added with
            the 'options' attribute:
                <configure options="-with-foobar CC=cc CXX=CC"/>
            Omitted for Windows builds.
        -->
        <configure/>

        <!--
            Compile the wxWidgets library, subdirectories and tests.

            Takes the following attributes which can all be either 'true' or
            'false':
                wx          - build the library
                samples     - build the samples
                utils       - build the utils
                demos       - build the demos
                contrib     - build the contrib
                tests       - build the tests
                msw         - the library makefile is under build\msw
                gui         - if 'false' builds only a subset of the above

            The attributes usually default to the right values.
