This directory contains Bakefile (see http://bakefile.sourceforge.net)
files needed to generate native makefiles for wxWidgets library and
samples.

Use the bakefile_gen utility to regenerate the makefiles (run it in this
directory!). If you run it with no arguments, it will generate all makefiles
that are not up to date.

Use "bakefile_gen -c" to clean generated files.

You can generate or clean only subset of files by specifying -f or -b flags
when invoking bakefile_gen. For example, "bakefile_gen -fborland,msvc" will
only regenerate Borland C++ and MSVC makefiles. -b flag limits
regeneration only to specified bakefiles. For example,
"bakefile_gen -b wx.bkl" will only regenerate main library makefiles.
"bakefile_gen -b "../../samples/html/*/*.bkl" will regenerate makefiles for
all wxHTML samples. -b and -f can be combined.

You can customize the process of generating makefiles by adding file
Bakefiles.local.bkgen (same format as Bakefiles.bkgen) with further settings.
For example, you may disable output for compilers you don't use:
   <?xml version="1.0" ?>
   <bakefile-gen>
     <disable-formats>msvc,msvs2003prj</disable-formats>
   </bakefile-gen>

Note: bakefile_gen creates file .bakefile_gen.state with dependencies
information. This file can be safely deleted, but it contains valuable
information that speed up regeneration process.

Note: the following files are generated using bakefile_gen:
  * build/msw/*
  * makefiles with same names as makefiles in above dirs, Makefile.in files 
    that contain "This makefile was generated by Bakefile" banner and
    VC++ project files in samples, demos and utils directories
  * src/wxWindows.dsp
  * autoconf_inc.m4
  * all Makefile.in files
  (hopefully I didn't forget anything - VS)
