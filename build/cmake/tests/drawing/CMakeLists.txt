# This test program is targeted to "headless GUI" tests, tests which are
# typically tied to the "core" component but that should run nicely in a
# console only program. This program should be executable from a console
# only Unix session (such as telnet or ssh) although it uses graphics
# contexts, so if you modify this project, please check that it can still
# be ran in such configuration and doesn't require an X server connection.

# This is a sample plugin, it simply uses a wxImage based
# wxGraphicsContext. It should render the same as the built-in test. Use
# the WX_TEST_SUITE_GC_DRAWING_PLUGINS variable to specify the location of
# the produced DLL/so to get it loaded and tested. To make your own plugin,
# you can copy this sample and link toward your own implementation of
# wxGraphicsContext interface, building the appropriate DrawingTestGCFactory
