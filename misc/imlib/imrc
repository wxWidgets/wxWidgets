# The file that contains palette entries for a global palette for all Imlib
# based programs.
# options: full path to palette file
PaletteFile                       /etc/im_palette.pal
# This defines if when the display is greater than 8 bit, that it still remaps
# the images to the palette defined, rather than using "perfect" rendering
# options: yes/no
PaletteOverride                   no
# If remapping to the palette, whether to use Floyd-Steinberg dithering. Saying
# yes will slow things down though.
# options: yes/no
Dither                            yes
# when remapping to the palette, saying fast will reduce accuracy, but improve
# speed quite considerably
# options: fast/slow
Remap                             fast
# This turns on dithering for 15/16 bpp. This makes smooth gradients look much
# smoother - in fact almost perfect. You will find it nigh impossible to tell
# the difference between 15/16bpp dithered and 24bpp. Unless you have extra
# CPU to burn, its not recommended, unless you are a image quality freak, and
# you insist on maximum quality in 15/16bpp. It does slow things down. It
# would be best to leave it off and let the applications themselves allow
# you to select it for certain purposes only.
HighQuality                       off
# This option if specified off will force MIT-SHM off, otherwise will allow
# Imlib to work it out itself.
Mit-Shm                           on
# This will turn shared pixmaps on or off (off forces off, on lets imlib
# work it out). This is yet another speedup. leave it on unless it doesn't
# work.. then turn it off.
SharedPixmaps                     off
# This speeds up rendering considerably, but may not work on your hardware
# due to it bypassing a few layers and byte-twiddling the rendered image data
# manually, and due to endianess, bit-ordering or RGB ordering it may screw up
# and not work, so try it.. if things work great!, if not, wait until a
# renderer for your situation is written, or write one yourself and donate
# it. It's easy to do, just look at rend.c
FastRender                        on
# This is in fact a workaround due to Solaris's shared memory theories.
# This specifies the maximum size of a shared memory chunk in bytes. If an
# image is larger that this in bytes for the video mode you're in, imlib will
# not use MIT-SHM. if you comment this out, imlib will use as much memory as
# necessary to render the image.
# Shm_Max_Size                      1000000
# This turns Image loading (24) bit caching on or off. HIGHLY suggested to be
# turned ON!
Image_Cache                       on
# Image cache size in bytes.  As with any cache, the more, the better.  If you
# load the same image more than once. Imlib will used a previously loaded
# copy, and if its freed, the Image_Cache_Size amount of bytes of image data
# are kept even after being freed, in case the same image is loaded again soon
# afterwards. Neat eh?
Image_Cache_Size                  4000000
# This turns the pixmap caching system on or off.  If on, only well-behaved
# programs that conform to the specs for using Imlib will exhibit the
# behavior as expected. It is suggested to leave this on, as it will boost
# performance considerably, speed-wise and memory-wise. The reason apps need
# to be well-behaved is so that they don't go drawing on, and XFreePixmap'ing
# these pixmaps themselves, because this will trample all over the cache
# and give very horrid effects, or even make the apps crash with segfaults or
# Xlib errors.
Pixmap_Cache                      on
# Pixmap cache is in **-> BITS <-**... the end result is APPROXIMATELY
# 10000000 bits of pixmap make your Xserver grow by 1Mb of RAM (VERY rough).
# As with any cache, the more, the better. The more you have, the less likely
# it is that you will get cache misses and so performance on scaling the same
# image to commonly used sizes (ie if 3 or 4 sizes of the same image are used)
# will be lightning fast, in fact in some tests I did, in 16bpp up to 38 times
# as fast, and in 8bpp (with dithering on) up to 105 times faster!!! (these
# are nominal figures obtained on my machine. these are MAXIMUM speedup
# results.  Results may vary on other machines and according to the way
# programs are written and use Imlib)
Pixmap_Cache_Size                 40000000
# This FORCES Imlib to use the hexadecimal visual id stated here if it is
# defined in the imrc. This bypasses Imlib's routines that hunt for the best
# visual. You can obtain a list of visual ID's using the xdpyinfo command.
# You should only need this if Imlib doesn't pick the correct visual or you
# have strange hardware/Xserver combinations.
#ForceVisualID                   22
# This allows Imlib to fall back on Imagemagick and/or NETPBM
# utilities if it can't load the file.
