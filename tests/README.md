Tests
-----

This directory contains tests for the library and is mostly useful for the
library developers. See the `samples` subdirectory for the examples that are
more useful to the application developers using the library.

If you do work on the library itself and would like to modify an existing or
add a new test, please see `docs/contributing/how-to-write-unit-tests.md` for
more information.

This file also contains the instructions for running the tests if you'd just
like to do it to confirm that the library works correctly.
