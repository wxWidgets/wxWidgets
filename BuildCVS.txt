                How to build the sources from CVS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

I) Windows using plain makefiles
----------------------------------------

a) Using the GNU MinGW32 or GNU CygWin32 compilers

You'll need the compiler itself which is available from

  http://www.cygwin.com

When using MingW32 you'll need GNU make which is part of
part of the CygWin32 toolchain and is also available as
a stand alone port without the infamous Cygwin.dll from

  http://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/~janjaap/mingw32

The makefile has small problems with Cygwin´s tools
so it is recommended not to use these (but MingGW32
and its make.exe).

-> Set your path so that it includes the directory
   where your compiler and tools reside
-> Assume that you installed the wxWindows sources
   into c:\wxWin
-> Copy c:\wxWin\include\wx\msw\setup0.h 
   to   c:\wxWin\include\wx\msw\setup.h
-> Edit c:\wxWin\include\wx\msw\setup.h so that
   most features are enabled (i.e. defined to 1) with
   #define wxUSE_SOCKETS       0
   #define wxUSE_HTML          0
   #define wxUSE_THREADS       1
   #define wxUSE_FS_INET       0
   #define wxUSE_FS_ZIP        0
   #define wxUSE_BUSYINFO      1
   #define wxUSE_DYNLIB_CLASS  1
   #define wxUSE_ZIPSTREAM     1
   #define wxUSE_JPEGLIB       1
   #define wxUSE_PNGLIB        1

   and disable iostreams with
   #define wxUSE_STD_IOSTREAM   0
-> type: cd c:\wxWin\src\msw
-> type: make -f makefile.g95

II) GTK port on Unix using plain makefiles.
------------------------------------------

Set WXWIN environment variable to the base directory such
as ~/wxWindows

-> type: export WXWIN=~/wxWindows
-> edit ~/wxWindows/src/gtk.env as you wish.
-> type: cd ~/wxWindows/src/gtk
-> type: cp ./setup0.h setup.h
-> type: make


III) Windows using configure
----------------------------------------

Take a look at Unix->Windows cross compiling. With minor
modifications, this should work in Windows if you've got the cygnus
utilities (bash, GNU make, etc) and either mingw32 or cygwin32 installed. 
See http://www.cygnus.com for these programs, or go straight to their
ftp server at ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/cygwin/. 

Of course, you can also build the library using plain makefiles (see 
section I).

IV) Unix using configure
----------------------------------------

a) You have all the newest and greatest GNU tools installed on your system 
and in the same directory hierachy (e.g. either all tools in /usr or all 
in /usr/local), these tools are:
- GNU libtool 1.2e (1.3 doesn't work here)
- GNU autoconf 2.13 (including autoheader 2.13)
- GNU automake 1.4 (including aclocal 1.4)
and possibly but not forcibly
- GNU make 3.76.1
- GNU C++ (EGCS)

-> Go to the base directory
-> type: ./autogen.sh

b) You don't know what autos are and have no driver's licence anyway:

-> Go to the testconf directory
-> type: ./apply

a+b) Then proceed in either case with:

-> Choose a directory name that seems fit for building wxWindows, e.g. mybuild
-> Go the base directory
-> type: mkdir mybuild
-> type: cd mybuild
-> type: ../configure --with-gtk   
or type: ../configure --with-motif
or type: ../configure --with-wine
-> type make
-> drink lots of coffee and go shopping


V) MacOS
----------------------------------------

VI) OS/2
----------------------------------------

VII) Unix->Windows cross-compiling using configure
--------------------------------------------------

First you'll need a cross-compiler; linux glibc binaries of mingw32 and
cygwin32 (both based on egcs) can be found at
ftp://ftp.objsw.com/pub/crossgcc/linux-x-win32. Otherwise you can 
compile one yourself. Check the relevant FAQs.

[ A Note about cygwin32 and mingw32: the main difference is that cygwin32
binaries are always linked against cygwin.dll. This dll encapsulates most
standard Unix C extensions, which is very handy if you're porting unix
software to windows. However, wxMSW doesn't need this, so mingw32 is
preferable if you write portable C(++). ]

You might want to build both Unix and Windows binaries in the same source
tree; to do this make subdirs for each e.g. unix and win32. If you've
already build wxWindows in the main dir, do a 'make distclean' there,
otherwise configure will get confused. (In any case, read the section 'Unix
using configure' and make sure you're able to build a native wxWindows
library; cross-compiling errors can be pretty obscure and you'll want to be
sure that your configure setup is basically sound.)

To cross compile the windows library, do
-> cd win32
Now run configure. There are two ways to do this
-> ../configure --host=i586-mingw32 --build=i586-linux --with-mingw \
   --enable-dnd=no
where --build= should read whatever platform you're building on. Configure
will notice that build and host platforms differ, and automatically prepend
i586-mingw32- to gcc, ar, ld, etc (make sure they're in the PATH!). 
The other way to run configure is by specifying the names of the binaries 
yourself:
-> CC=i586-mingw32-gcc CXX=i586-mingw32-g++ RANLIB=i586-mingw32-ranlib \
   DLLTOOL=i586-mingw32-dlltool LD=i586-mingw32-ld NM=i586-mingw32-nm \
   ../configure --host=i586-mingw32 --with-mingw --enable-dnd=no

(all assuming you're using mingw32)
Drag'n'drop is disabled because mingw32 lacks (AFAIK) OLE headers.

Configure will conclude that shared libraries are out of the question and
opt for a static one. I haven't looked into DLL creation yet.

Type 
-> make -C src
and wait, wait, wait. Don't leave the room, because the minute you do there
will be a compile error :-)

If this is successful, try building the minimal sample:
-> cd samples/minimal
-> make
-> mv minimal minimal.exe

and run it with wine, for example
-> wine minimal.exe

If all is well, do an install; from win32
-> make install

Native and cross-compiled installations can co-exist peacefully 
(as long as their widget sets differ), except for wx-config. You might 
want to rename the cross-compiled one to i586-mingw32-wx-config, or something.

Cross-compiling TODO:
---------------------
- resource compiling must be done manually for now (should/can we link the 
default wx resources into libwx_msw.a?) [ No we can't; the linker won't
link it in... you have to supply an object file ]
- dynamic libraries
- static executables are HUGE -- there must be room for improvement.
