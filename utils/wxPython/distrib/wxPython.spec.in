%description

This Python package consists of an extension module that wraps around the
wxWindows C++ class library and provides a cross platform GUI toolkit for
use with Python.  Currently supported platforms are Win32 and Unix/GTK/X.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules,
classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing.
There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, and new built-in
modules are easily written in C or C++.  Python is also usable as an
extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
