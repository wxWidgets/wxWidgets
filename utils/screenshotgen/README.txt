 This utility is developed to automatically generate screenshots of the wxWidgets
 controls for use in wxWidgets documentation.

 The main part of the GUI (guiframe.h/guiframe.cpp) was generated with wxFormBuilder
 (http://wxformbuilder.org/), a powerful cross-platform open-source RAD tool. Now its
 trace is removed so we can maintain the code without using it.


===User Guide: How To Use==

The screenshots will be generated under sub-directory "screenshots" silently.
Please monitor this folder before taking screenshots using "File->Open screenshots folder".

1) The menu "Capture->Full screen" can take a screeshot for the fullscreen. It's designed
for testing purpose only.

2) The menu "Capture->Regions<Begin>" and "Capture->Regions<End>" was the semi-auto part,
and now it's deprecated and will be removed soon.

3) Finally the full-auto mode: "Capture->Capture All" or Ctrl+Alt+A, follow the instructions
 and all the screenshots will be generated correctly under the subdirectory "screenshots".

 ==Developer Guide: How To Add More Controls==

 (Coming soon)

 ==To-do List==

 1) Remove wxAuiNoteBook related lagacy codes, which is no longer useful;

 2) Refactor the GUI code, which was generated by wxFormBuilder, but it's messy for human to
 maintain;

 3) Remove the class CtrlMaskOut since semi-auto part of this utility is no longer needed.

 4) Clearify the interface of class AutoCaptureMechanism and document how to add a new control
 that needs to take screenshots, and how to adjust it to avoid bugs in wxRTTI system and
 wxWindow::GetScreenRect();

 5) Make this utility easier to configure;

 6) Add test functionality to confirm bugs in wxRTTI system and wxWindow::GetScreenRect().
