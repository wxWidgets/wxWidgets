    @class wxDC

    A wxDC is a @e "device context" onto which graphics and text can be drawn.
    It is intended to represent different output devices and offers a common
    abstract API for drawing on any of them.

    wxWidgets offers an alternative drawing API based on the modern drawing
    backends GDI+, CoreGraphics, Cairo and Direct2D. See wxGraphicsContext,
    wxGraphicsRenderer and related classes. There is also a wxGCDC linking
    the APIs by offering the wxDC API on top of a wxGraphicsContext.

    wxDC is an abstract base class and cannot be created directly.
    Use wxPaintDC, wxClientDC, wxWindowDC, wxScreenDC, wxMemoryDC or
    wxPrinterDC. Notice that device contexts which are associated with windows
    (i.e. wxClientDC, wxWindowDC and wxPaintDC) use the window font and colours
    by default (starting with wxWidgets 2.9.0) but the other device context
    classes use system-default values so you always must set the appropriate
    fonts and colours before using them.

    In addition to the versions of the methods documented below, there
    are also versions which accept single wxPoint parameter instead
    of the two wxCoord ones or wxPoint and wxSize instead of the four
    wxCoord parameters.

    Beginning with wxWidgets 2.9.0 the entire wxDC code has been
    reorganized. All platform dependent code (actually all drawing code)
    has been moved into backend classes which derive from a common
    wxDCImpl class. The user-visible classes such as wxClientDC and
    wxPaintDC merely forward all calls to the backend implementation.


    @section dc_units Device and logical units

    In the wxDC context there is a distinction between @e logical units and @e device units.

    @b Device units are the units native to the particular device; e.g. for a screen,
    a device unit is a @e pixel. For a printer, the device unit is defined by the
    resolution of the printer (usually given in @c DPI: dot-per-inch).

    All wxDC functions use instead @b logical units, unless where explicitly
    stated. Logical units are arbitrary units mapped to device units using
    the current mapping mode (see wxDC::SetMapMode).

    This mechanism allows reusing the same code which prints on e.g. a window
    on the screen to print on e.g. a paper.


    @section dc_alpha_support Support for Transparency / Alpha Channel

    In general wxDC methods don't support alpha transparency and the alpha
    component of wxColour is simply ignored and you need to use wxGraphicsContext
    for full transparency support. There are, however, a few exceptions: first,
    under OS X and GTK+ 3 colours with alpha channel are supported in all the normal
    wxDC-derived classes as they use wxGraphicsContext internally. Second,
    under all platforms wxSVGFileDC also fully supports alpha channel. In both
    of these cases the instances of wxPen or wxBrush that are built from
    wxColour use the colour's alpha values when stroking or filling.


    @section dc_transform_support Support for Transformation Matrix

    On some platforms (currently under MSW, GTK+ 3, OS X) wxDC has support for
    applying an arbitrary affine transformation matrix to its coordinate system
    (since 3.1.1 this feature is also supported by wxGCDC in all ports).
    Call CanUseTransformMatrix() to check if this support is available and then
    call SetTransformMatrix() if it is. If the transformation matrix is not
    supported, SetTransformMatrix() always simply returns @c false and doesn't
    do anything.

    This feature is only available when @c wxUSE_DC_TRANSFORM_MATRIX build
    option is enabled.

        while copying. The same can be achieved by changing the scale of the
        source or target DC but calling this method is simpler and can also be
        more efficient if the platform provides a native implementation of it.

        The meaning of its other parameters is the same as with Blit(), in
        particular all source coordinates are interpreted using the source DC
        coordinate system, i.e. are affected by its scale, origin translation
        and axis direction.

        @param xdest
            Destination device context x position.
        @param ydest
            Destination device context y position.
        @param dstWidth
            Width of destination area.
        @param dstHeight
            Height of destination area.
        @param source
            Source device context.
        @param xsrc
            Source device context x position.
        @param ysrc
            Source device context y position.
        @param srcWidth
            Width of source area to be copied.
        @param srcHeight
            Height of source area to be copied.
        @param logicalFunc
            Logical function to use, see SetLogicalFunction().
        @param useMask
            If @true, Blit does a transparent blit using the mask that is
            associated with the bitmap selected into the source device context.
            The Windows implementation does the following if MaskBlt cannot be
            used:
            <ol>
            <li>Creates a temporary bitmap and copies the destination area into
                it.</li>
            <li>Copies the source area into the temporary bitmap using the
                specified logical function.</li>
            <li>Sets the masked area in the temporary bitmap to BLACK by ANDing
                the mask bitmap with the temp bitmap with the foreground colour
                set to WHITE and the bg colour set to BLACK.</li>
            <li>Sets the unmasked area in the destination area to BLACK by
                ANDing the mask bitmap with the destination area with the
                foreground colour set to BLACK and the background colour set to
                WHITE.</li>
            <li>ORs the temporary bitmap with the destination area.</li>
            <li>Deletes the temporary bitmap.</li>
            </ol>
            This sequence of operations ensures that the source's transparent
            area need not be black, and logical functions are supported.
            @n @b Note: on Windows, blitting with masks can be speeded up
            considerably by compiling wxWidgets with the wxUSE_DC_CACHEING option
            enabled. You can also influence whether MaskBlt or the explicit
            mask blitting code above is used, by using wxSystemOptions and
            setting the @c no-maskblt option to 1.
        @param xsrcMask
            Source x position on the mask. If both xsrcMask and ysrcMask are
            wxDefaultCoord, @a xsrc and @a ysrc will be assumed for the mask
            source position. Currently only implemented on Windows.
        @param ysrcMask
            Source y position on the mask. If both xsrcMask and ysrcMask are
            wxDefaultCoord, @a xsrc and @a ysrc will be assumed for the mask
            source position. Currently only implemented on Windows.

        There is partial support for Blit() in wxPostScriptDC, under X.

/**
    @class wxDCClipper

    wxDCClipper is a helper class for setting a clipping region on a wxDC
    during its lifetime.

    An object of wxDCClipper class is typically created on the stack so that it
    is automatically destroyed when the object goes out of scope. A typical
    usage example:

    @code
    void MyFunction(wxDC& dc)
    {
        wxDCClipper clip(dc, rect);
        // ... drawing functions here are affected by clipping rect ...

        // ... drawing functions here are not affected by clipping rect ...
    }
    @endcode

    @note Since 3.1.1 wxDCClipper restores the previously active clipping
        region when it is destroyed. Previously it reset clipping on the
        associated wxDC and this has to be taken into account explicitly in
