/**
    @class wxBufferedDC

    This class provides a simple way to avoid flicker: when drawing on it,
    everything is in fact first drawn on an in-memory buffer (a wxBitmap) and
    then copied to the screen, using the associated wxDC, only once, when this
    object is destroyed. wxBufferedDC itself is typically associated with
    wxClientDC, if you want to use it in your @c EVT_PAINT handler, you should
    look at wxBufferedPaintDC instead.

    When used like this, a valid @e DC must be specified in the constructor
    while the @e buffer bitmap doesn't have to be explicitly provided, by
    default this class will allocate the bitmap of required size itself.
    However using a dedicated bitmap can speed up the redrawing process by
    eliminating the repeated creation and destruction of a possibly big bitmap.
    Otherwise, wxBufferedDC can be used in the same way as any other device
    context.

    Another possible use for wxBufferedDC is to use it to maintain a
    backing store for the window contents. In this case, the associated @e DC
    may be @NULL but a valid backing store bitmap should be specified.

    Finally, please note that GTK+ 2.0 as well as OS X provide double buffering
    themselves natively. You can either use wxWindow::IsDoubleBuffered() to
    determine whether you need to use buffering or not, or use
    wxAutoBufferedPaintDC to avoid needless double buffering on the systems
    which already do it automatically.

    This wxDC derivative can be used inside of an @c EVT_PAINT() event handler

    wxBG_STYLE_PAINT somewhere in the class initialization code, and that's

    The difference between wxBufferedPaintDC and this class is that this class
    won't double-buffer on platforms which have native double-buffering
    already, avoiding any unnecessary buffering to avoid flicker.

    wxAutoBufferedPaintDC is simply a typedef of wxPaintDC on platforms that
    have native double-buffering, otherwise, it is a typedef of
    wxBufferedPaintDC.
