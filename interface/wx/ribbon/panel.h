/**
    @class wxRibbonPanel

    Serves as a container for a group of (ribbon) controls. A wxRibbonPage will
    typically have panels for children, with the controls for that page placed
    on the panels.

    A panel adds a border and label to a group of controls, and can be
    minimised (either automatically to conserve space, or manually by the user).

    Non ribbon controls can be placed on a panel using wxSizers to manage
    layout. Panel size is governed by the sizer's minimum calculated size and
    the parent wxRibbonPage's dimensions. For functional and aesthetic reasons
    it is recommended that ribbon and non ribbon controls are not mixed in one
    panel.

    @sa wxRibbonPage

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_DEFAULT_STYLE}
        Defined as no other flags set.
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_NO_AUTO_MINIMISE}
        Prevents the panel from automatically minimising to conserve screen
        space.
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_EXT_BUTTON}
        Causes an extension button to be shown in the panel's chrome (if the
        bar in which it is contained has wxRIBBON_BAR_SHOW_PANEL_EXT_BUTTONS
        set). The behaviour of this button is application controlled, but
        typically will show an extended drop-down menu relating to the
        panel.
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_MINIMISE_BUTTON}
        Causes a (de)minimise button to be shown in the panel's chrome (if
        the bar in which it is contained has the
        wxRIBBON_BAR_SHOW_PANEL_MINIMISE_BUTTONS style set). This flag is
        typically combined with wxRIBBON_PANEL_NO_AUTO_MINIMISE to make a
        panel which the user always has manual control over when it
        minimises.
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_STRETCH}
        Stretches a single panel to fit the parent page.
    @style{wxRIBBON_PANEL_FLEXIBLE}
        Allows the panel to size in both directions; currently only useful
        when a single wxRibbonToolBar is the child of the panel, particularly
        in vertical orientation where the number of rows is dependent on the
        amount of horizontal space available. Set the minimum and maximum
        toolbar rows to take full advantage of this wrapping behaviour.
    @endStyleTable

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxRibbonPanelEvent}
    @event{EVT_RIBBONPANEL_EXTBUTTON_ACTIVATED(id, func)}
        Triggered when the user activate the panel extension button.
