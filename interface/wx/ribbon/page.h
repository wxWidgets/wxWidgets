        page rather than children of the page (to achieve correct cropping and
        paint ordering of the children and the buttons). When there are no scroll
        buttons, this function behaves the same as SetSize(), however when there
        are scroll buttons, it positions them at the edges of the given area, and
        then calls SetSize() with the remaining area.
    
        This is provided as a separate function to SetSize() rather than within
        the implementation of SetSize(), as iteracting algorithms may not expect
        SetSize() to also set the size of siblings.
