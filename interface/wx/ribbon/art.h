    @class wxRibbonArtProvider

    wxRibbonArtProvider is responsible for drawing all the components of the ribbon
    interface. This allows a ribbon bar to have a pluggable look-and-feel, while
    retaining the same underlying behaviour. As a single art provider is used for
    all ribbon components, a ribbon bar usually has a consistent (though unique)
    appearance.

    By default, a wxRibbonBar uses an instance of this class called
    @c wxRibbonDefaultArtProvider, which resolves to @c wxRibbonAUIArtProvider,
    @c wxRibbonMSWArtProvider, or @c wxRibbonOSXArtProvider - whichever is most appropriate
    to the current platform. These art providers are all slightly configurable with
    regard to colours and fonts, but for larger modifications, you can derive from
    one of these classes, or write a completely new art provider class.
    Call wxRibbonBar::SetArtProvider to change the art provider being used.
