    @class wxTopLevelWindow

    wxTopLevelWindow is a common base class for wxDialog and wxFrame. It is an
    abstract base class meaning that you never work with objects of this class
    directly, but all of its methods are also applicable for the two classes
    above.

    Note that the instances of wxTopLevelWindow are managed by wxWidgets in the
    internal top level window list.

    @beginEventEmissionTable
    @event{EVT_MAXIMIZE(id, func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_MAXIMIZE event. See wxMaximizeEvent.
    @event{EVT_MOVE(func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_MOVE event, which is generated when a window is moved.
        See wxMoveEvent.
    @event{EVT_MOVE_START(func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_MOVE_START event, which is generated when the user starts
        to move or size a window. wxMSW only.
        See wxMoveEvent.
    @event{EVT_MOVE_END(func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_MOVE_END event, which is generated when the user stops
        moving or sizing a window. wxMSW only.
        See wxMoveEvent.
    @event{EVT_SHOW(func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_SHOW event. See wxShowEvent.
