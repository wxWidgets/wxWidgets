/**
    @class wxConfigBase

    wxConfigBase defines the basic interface of all config classes. It cannot
    be used by itself (it is an abstract base class) and you will always use
    one of its derivations: wxFileConfig, wxRegConfig or any other.

    However, usually you don't even need to know the precise nature of the
    class you're working with but you would just use the wxConfigBase methods.
    This allows you to write the same code regardless of whether you're working
    with the registry under Windows or text-based config files under Unix. 
    To make writing the portable code even easier, wxWidgets provides a typedef 
    wxConfig which is mapped onto the native wxConfigBase implementation on the 
    given platform: i.e. wxRegConfig under Windows and wxFileConfig otherwise.

    See @ref overview_config for a description of all features of this class.

    It is highly recommended to use static functions Get() and/or Set(), so
    please have a look at them.

    @section configbase_example Example

    Here is how you would typically use this class:

    @code
    // using wxConfig instead of writing wxFileConfig or wxRegConfig enhances
    // portability of the code
    wxConfig *config = new wxConfig("MyAppName");

    wxString str;
    if ( config->Read("LastPrompt", &str) ) {
        // last prompt was found in the config file/registry and its value is
        // now in str
        // ...
    }
    else {
        // no last prompt...
    }

    // another example: using default values and the full path instead of just
    // key name: if the key is not found , the value 17 is returned
    long value = config->ReadLong("/LastRun/CalculatedValues/MaxValue", 17);

    // at the end of the program we would save everything back
    config->Write("LastPrompt", str);
    config->Write("/LastRun/CalculatedValues/MaxValue", value);

    // the changes will be written back automatically
    delete config;
    @endcode

    This basic example, of course, doesn't show all wxConfig features, such as
    enumerating, testing for existence and deleting the entries and groups of
    entries in the config file, its abilities to automatically store the
    default values or expand the environment variables on the fly. However, the
    main idea is that using this class is easy and that it should normally do
    what you expect it to.

    @note In the documentation of this class, the words "config file" also mean
          "registry hive" for wxRegConfig and, generally speaking, might mean
          any physical storage where a wxConfigBase-derived class stores its
          data.


    @section configbase_static Static Functions

    The static functions provided deal with the "default" config object.
    Although its usage is not at all mandatory it may be convenient to use a
    global config object instead of creating and deleting the local config
    objects each time you need one (especially because creating a wxFileConfig
    object might be a time consuming operation). In this case, you may create
    this global config object in the very start of the program and Set() it as
    the default. Then, from anywhere in your program, you may access it using
    the Get() function. This global wxConfig object will be deleted by
    wxWidgets automatically if it exists. Note that this implies that if you do
    delete this object yourself (usually in wxApp::OnExit()) you must use
    Set(@NULL) to prevent wxWidgets from deleting it the second time.

    As it happens, you may even further simplify the procedure described above:
    you may forget about calling Set(). When Get() is called and there is no
    current object, it will create one using Create() function. To disable this
    behaviour DontCreateOnDemand() is provided.

    @note You should use either Set() or Get() because wxWidgets library itself
          would take advantage of it and could save various information in it.
          For example wxFontMapper or Unix version of wxFileDialog have the
          ability to use wxConfig class.


    @section configbase_paths Path Management

    As explained in the @ref overview_config "config overview", the config
    classes support a file system-like hierarchy of keys (files) and groups
    (directories). As in the file system case, to specify a key in the config
    class you must use a path to it. Config classes also support the notion of
    the current group, which makes it possible to use the relative paths. To
    clarify all this, here is an example (it is only for the sake of
    demonstration, it doesn't do anything sensible!):

    @code
    wxConfig *config = new wxConfig("FooBarApp");

    // right now the current path is '/'
    conf->Write("RootEntry", 1);

    // go to some other place: if the group(s) don't exist, they will be created
    conf->SetPath("/Group/Subgroup");

    // create an entry in subgroup
    conf->Write("SubgroupEntry", 3);

    // '..' is understood
    conf->Write("../GroupEntry", 2);
    conf->SetPath("..");

    wxASSERT( conf->ReadLong("Subgroup/SubgroupEntry", 0) == 3 );

    // use absolute path: it is allowed, too
    wxASSERT( conf->ReadLong("/RootEntry", 0) == 1 );
    @endcode

    It is highly recommended that you restore the path to its old value on
    function exit:

    @code
    void foo(wxConfigBase *config)
    {
        wxString strOldPath = config->GetPath();

        config->SetPath("/Foo/Data");
        // ...

        config->SetPath(strOldPath);
    }
    @endcode

    Otherwise the assert in the following example will surely fail (we suppose
    here that the foo() function is the same as above except that it doesnâ€™t
    save and restore the path):

    @code
    void bar(wxConfigBase *config)
    {
        config->Write("Test", 17);

        foo(config);

        // we're reading "/Foo/Data/Test" here! -1 will probably be returned...
        wxASSERT( config->ReadLong("Test", -1) == 17 );
    }
    @endcode

    Finally, the path separator in wxConfigBase and derived classes is always
    "/", regardless of the platform (i.e. it is not "\\" under Windows).


    @section configbase_enumeration Enumeration

    The enumeration functions allow you to enumerate all entries and groups in
    the config file. All functions here return @false when there are no more
    items.

    You must pass the same index to GetNext() and GetFirst() (don't modify it).
    Please note that it is not the index of the current item (you will have
    some great surprises with wxRegConfig if you assume this) and you shouldn't
    even look at it: it is just a "cookie" which stores the state of the
    enumeration. It can't be stored inside the class because it would prevent
    you from running several enumerations simultaneously, that's why you must
    pass it explicitly.

    Having said all this, enumerating the config entries/groups is very simple:

    @code
    wxConfigBase *config = ...;
    wxArrayString aNames;

    // enumeration variables
    wxString str;
    long dummy;

    // first enum all entries
    bool bCont = config->GetFirstEntry(str, dummy);
    while ( bCont ) {
        aNames.Add(str);

        bCont = GetConfig()->GetNextEntry(str, dummy);
    }

    // ... we have all entry names in aNames...

    // now all groups...
    bCont = GetConfig()->GetFirstGroup(str, dummy);
    while ( bCont ) {
        aNames.Add(str);

        bCont = GetConfig()->GetNextGroup(str, dummy);
    }

    // ... we have all group (and entry) names in aNames...
    @endcode

    There are also functions to get the number of entries/subgroups without
    actually enumerating them, but you will probably never need them.


    @section configbase_keyaccess Key Access

    The key access functions are the core of wxConfigBase class: they allow you
    to read and write config file data. All Read() functions take a default
    value which will be returned if the specified key is not found in the
    config file.

    Currently, supported types of data are: wxString, @c long, @c double,
    @c bool, wxColour and any other types for which the functions
    wxToString() and wxFromString() are defined.

    Try not to read long values into string variables and vice versa:
    although it just might work with wxFileConfig, you will get a system
    error with wxRegConfig because in the Windows registry the different
    types of entries are indeed used.

    Final remark: the @a szKey parameter for all these functions can
    contain an arbitrary path (either relative or absolute), not just the
    key name.

class wxConfigBase : public wxObject
{
public:
    /**
        This is the default and only constructor of the wxConfigBase class, and
        derived classes.

        @param appName
            The application name. If this is empty, the class will normally use
            wxApp::GetAppName() to set it. The application name is used in the
            registry key on Windows, and can be used to deduce the local
            filename parameter if that is missing.
        @param vendorName
            The vendor name. If this is empty, it is assumed that no vendor
            name is wanted, if this is optional for the current config class.
            The vendor name is appended to the application name for
            wxRegConfig.
        @param localFilename
            Some config classes require a local filename. If this is not
            present, but required, the application name will be used instead.
        @param globalFilename
            Some config classes require a global filename. If this is not
            present, but required, the application name will be used instead.
        @param style
            Can be one of @c wxCONFIG_USE_LOCAL_FILE and @c wxCONFIG_USE_GLOBAL_FILE.
            @n The style interpretation depends on the config class and is ignored
            by some implementations. For wxFileConfig, these styles determine
            whether a local or global config file is created or used: if
            @c wxCONFIG_USE_GLOBAL_FILE is used, then settings are read from the
            global config file and if @c wxCONFIG_USE_LOCAL_FILE is used, settings
            are read from and written to local config file (if they are both
            set, global file is read first, then local file, overwriting global
            settings). If the flag is present but the parameter is empty, the
            parameter will be set to a default. If the parameter is present but
            the style flag not, the relevant flag will be added to the style.
            For wxRegConfig, the GLOBAL flag refers to the @c HKLM key while LOCAL
            one is for the usual @c HKCU one.
            @n For wxFileConfig you can also add @c wxCONFIG_USE_RELATIVE_PATH by
            logically or'ing it to either of the _FILE options to tell
            wxFileConfig to use relative instead of absolute paths.
            @n On non-VMS Unix systems, the default local configuration file is
            "~/.appname". However, this path may be also used as user data
            directory (see wxStandardPaths::GetUserDataDir()) if the
            application has several data files. In this case
            @c wxCONFIG_USE_SUBDIR flag, which changes the default local
            configuration file to "~/.appname/appname" should be used. Notice
            that this flag is ignored if @a localFilename is provided.
            @c wxCONFIG_USE_SUBDIR is new since wxWidgets version 2.8.2.
            @n For wxFileConfig, you can also add
            @c wxCONFIG_USE_NO_ESCAPE_CHARACTERS which will turn off character
            escaping for the values of entries stored in the config file: for
            example a foo key with some backslash characters will be stored as
            "foo=C:\mydir" instead of the usual storage of "foo=C:\\mydir".
            @n The @c wxCONFIG_USE_NO_ESCAPE_CHARACTERS style can be helpful if your
            config file must be read or written to by a non-wxWidgets program
            (which might not understand the escape characters). Note, however,
            that if @c wxCONFIG_USE_NO_ESCAPE_CHARACTERS style is used, it is
            now your application's responsibility to ensure that there is no
            newline or other illegal characters in a value, before writing that
            value to the file.
        @param conv
            This parameter is only used by wxFileConfig when compiled in
            Unicode mode. It specifies the encoding in which the configuration
            file is written.

        @remarks By default, environment variable expansion is on and recording
                 defaults is off.

    /**
        @name Options

        Some aspects of wxConfigBase behaviour can be changed during run-time.
        The first of them is the expansion of environment variables in the
        string values read from the config file: for example, if you have the
        following in your config file:

        @code
        # config file for my program
        UserData = $HOME/data

        # the following syntax is valid only under Windows
        UserData = %windir%\\data.dat
        @endcode

        The call to Read("UserData") will return something like
        @c "/home/zeitlin/data" on linux for example.

        Although this feature is very useful, it may be annoying if you read a
        value which contains '$' or '%' symbols (% is used for environment
        variables expansion under Windows) which are not used for environment
        variable expansion. In this situation you may call
        SetExpandEnvVars(@false) just before reading this value and
        SetExpandEnvVars(@true) just after. Another solution would be to prefix
        the offending symbols with a backslash.
