    @class wxNotificationMessage

    This class allows to show the user a message non intrusively.

    Currently it is implemented natively for Windows, OS X, GTK and uses
    generic toast notifications under the other platforms. It's not recommended
    but @c wxGenericNotificationMessage can be used instead of the native ones.
    This might make sense if your application requires features not available in
    the native implementation.

    Notice that this class is not a window and so doesn't derive from wxWindow.

    @section platform_notes Platform Notes

    @par Windows
    Up to Windows 8 balloon notifications are displayed from an icon in the
    notification area of the taskbar. If your application uses a wxTaskBarIcon
    you should call UseTaskBarIcon() to ensure that only one icon is shown in
    the notification area. Windows 10 displays all notifications as popup
    toasts. To suppress the additional icon in the notification area on
    Windows 10 and for toast notification support on Windows 8 it is
    recommended to call MSWUseToasts() before showing the first notification
    message.
    
    @par OS X
    The OS X implementation uses Notification Center to display native notifications.
    In order to use actions your notifications must use the alert style. This can
    be enabled by the user in system settings or by setting the
    @c NSUserNotificationAlertStyle value in Info.plist to @c alert. Please note
    that the user always has the option to change the notification style.

           is clicked.
    @event{wxEVT_NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE_DISMISSED(id, func)}
           Process a @c wxEVT_NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE_DISMISSED event, when a notification
           is dismissed by the user or times out.
    @event{wxEVT_NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE_ACTION(id, func)}
           Process a @c wxEVT_NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE_ACTION event, when the user
