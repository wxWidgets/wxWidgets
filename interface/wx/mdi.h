    @class wxMDIClientWindow

    An MDI client window is a child of wxMDIParentFrame, and manages zero or
    more wxMDIChildFrame objects.

    @remarks

    The client window is the area where MDI child windows exist. It doesn't have to
    cover the whole parent frame; other windows such as toolbars and a help window
    might coexist with it. There can be scrollbars on a client window, which are
    controlled by the parent window style.

    The wxMDIClientWindow class is usually adequate without further derivation, and
    it is created automatically when the MDI parent frame is created. If the application
    needs to derive a new class, the function wxMDIParentFrame::OnCreateClient() must
    be overridden in order to give an opportunity to use a different class of client
    window.

    Under wxMSW, the client window will automatically have a sunken border style
    when the active child is not maximized, and no border style when a child is maximized.

/**
    @class wxMDIParentFrame

    An MDI (Multiple Document Interface) parent frame is a window which can
    contain MDI child frames in its client area which emulates the full
    desktop.

    MDI is a user-interface model in which all the window reside inside the
    single parent window as opposed to being separate from each other. It
    remains popular despite dire warnings from Microsoft itself (which
    popularized this model in the first model) that MDI is obsolete.

    An MDI parent frame always has a wxMDIClientWindow associated with it,
    which is the parent for MDI child frames. In the simplest case, the client
    window takes up the entire parent frame area but it is also possible to
    resize it to be smaller in order to have other windows in the frame, a
    typical example is using a sidebar along one of the window edges.

    The appearance of MDI applications differs between different ports. The
    classic MDI model, with child windows which can be independently moved,
    resized etc, is only available under MSW, which provides native support for
    it. In Mac ports, multiple top level windows are used for the MDI children
    too and the MDI parent frame itself is invisible, to accommodate the native
    look and feel requirements. In all the other ports, a tab-based MDI
    implementation (sometimes called TDI) is used and so at most one MDI child
    is visible at any moment (child frames are always maximized).

    @remarks

    Although it is possible to have multiple MDI parent frames, a typical MDI
    application has a single MDI parent frame window inside which multiple MDI
    child frames, i.e. objects of class wxMDIChildFrame, can be created.


    @beginStyleTable

    There are no special styles for this class, all wxFrame styles apply to it
    in the usual way. The only exception is that wxHSCROLL and wxVSCROLL styles
    apply not to the frame itself but to the client window, so that using them
    enables horizontal and vertical scrollbars for this window and not the
    frame.

        as well as painting a bitmap or pattern, since in @b OnScroll, the scrollbar

        To remove the window completely, you can use the wxFRAME_NO_WINDOW_MENU
        window style but this function also allows to do it by passing @NULL

    An MDI child frame is a frame that can only exist inside a
    wxMDIClientWindow, which is itself a child of wxMDIParentFrame.

    @remarks
    Although internally an MDI child frame is a child of the MDI client window,
    in wxWidgets you create it as a child of wxMDIParentFrame. In fact, you can
    usually forget that the client window exists. MDI child frames are clipped
    to the area of the MDI client window, and may be iconized on the client
    window. You can associate a menubar with a child frame as usual, although
    an MDI child doesn't display its menubar under its own title bar. The MDI
    parent frame's menubar will be changed to reflect the currently active
    child frame. If there are currently no children, the parent frame's own
    menubar will be displayed.
