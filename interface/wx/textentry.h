        Sets a hint shown in an empty unfocused text control.

        The hints are usually used to indicate to the user what is supposed to
        be entered into the given entry field, e.g. a common use of them is to
        show an explanation of what can be entered in a wxSearchCtrl.

        The hint is shown (usually greyed out) for an empty control until it
        gets focus and is shown again if the control loses it and remains
        empty. It won't be shown once the control has a non-empty value,
        although it will be shown again if the control contents is cleared.
        Because of this, it generally only makes sense to use hints with the
        controls which are initially empty.

        Notice that hints are known as <em>cue banners</em> under MSW or
        <em>placeholder strings</em> under OS X.

        @remarks Currently implemented natively on Windows (Vista and later
            only), OS X and GTK+ (3.2 and later).

            For the platforms without native hints support, the implementation
            has several known limitations. Notably, the hint display will not
            be properly updated if you change wxTextEntry contents
            programmatically when the hint is displayed using methods other
            than SetValue() or ChangeValue() or others which use them
            internally (e.g. Clear()). In other words, currently you should
            avoid calling methods such as WriteText() or Replace() when using
            hints and the text control is empty. If you bind to the control's
            focus and wxEVT_TEXT events, you must call wxEvent::Skip() on them
            so that the generic implementation works correctly.

            Another limitation is that hints are ignored for the controls with
            @c wxTE_PASSWORD style.

        @remarks Hints can be used for single line text controls under all
            platforms, but only MSW and GTK+ 2 support them for multi-line text
            controls, they are ignored for them under the other platforms.
