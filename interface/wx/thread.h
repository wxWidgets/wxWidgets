/**
    @class wxCondition

    wxCondition variables correspond to pthread conditions or to Win32 event objects.
    They may be used in a multithreaded application to wait until the given condition
    becomes @true which happens when the condition becomes signaled.

    @note In C++11 programs, prefer using @c std::condition to this class.

    For example, if a worker thread is doing some long task and another thread has
    to wait until it is finished, the latter thread will wait on the condition
    object and the worker thread will signal it on exit (this example is not
    perfect because in this particular case it would be much better to just
    wxThread::Wait for the worker thread, but if there are several worker threads
    it already makes much more sense).

    Note that a call to wxCondition::Signal may happen before the other thread calls
    wxCondition::Wait and, just as with the pthread conditions, the signal is then
    lost and so if you want to be sure that you don't miss it you must keep the
    mutex associated with the condition initially locked and lock it again before calling
    wxCondition::Signal. Of course, this means that this call is going to block
    until wxCondition::Wait is called by another thread.

    @section condition_example Example

    This example shows how a main thread may launch a worker thread which starts
    running and then waits until the main thread signals it to continue:

    @code
    class MySignallingThread : public wxThread
    {
    public:
        MySignallingThread(wxMutex *mutex, wxCondition *condition)
        {
            m_mutex = mutex;
            m_condition = condition;
        }

        virtual ExitCode Entry()
        {
            ... do our job ...

            // tell the other(s) thread(s) that we're about to terminate: we must
            // lock the mutex first or we might signal the condition before the
            // waiting threads start waiting on it!
            wxMutexLocker lock(*m_mutex);
            m_condition->Broadcast(); // same as Signal() here -- one waiter only

            return 0;
        }

    private:
        wxCondition *m_condition;
        wxMutex *m_mutex;
    };

    int main()
    {
        wxMutex mutex;
        wxCondition condition(mutex);

        // the mutex should be initially locked
        mutex.Lock();

        // create and run the thread but notice that it won't be able to
        // exit (and signal its exit) before we unlock the mutex below
        MySignallingThread *thread = new MySignallingThread(&mutex, &condition);

        thread->Run();

        // wait for the thread termination: Wait() atomically unlocks the mutex
        // which allows the thread to continue and starts waiting
        condition.Wait();

        // now we can exit
        return 0;
    }
    @endcode

    Of course, here it would be much better to simply use a joinable thread and
    call wxThread::Wait on it, but this example does illustrate the importance of
    properly locking the mutex when using wxCondition.

/**
    @class wxCriticalSectionLocker

    This is a small helper class to be used with wxCriticalSection objects.

    A wxCriticalSectionLocker enters the critical section in the constructor and
    leaves it in the destructor making it much more difficult to forget to leave
    a critical section (which, in general, will lead to serious and difficult
    to debug problems).

    Example of using it:

    @code
    void Set Foo()
    {
        // gs_critSect is some (global) critical section guarding access to the
        // object "foo"
        wxCriticalSectionLocker locker(gs_critSect);

        if ( ... )
        {
            // do something
            ...

            return;
        }

        // do something else
        ...

        return;
    }
    @endcode

    Without wxCriticalSectionLocker, you would need to remember to manually leave
    the critical section before each @c return.

    @library{wxbase}
    @category{threading}

    @see wxCriticalSection, wxMutexLocker
*/
class wxCriticalSectionLocker
{
public:

/**
    @class wxThreadHelper

    The wxThreadHelper class is a mix-in class that manages a single background
    thread, either detached or joinable (see wxThread for the differences).
    By deriving from wxThreadHelper, a class can implement the thread
    code in its own wxThreadHelper::Entry() method and easily share data and
    synchronization objects between the main thread and the worker thread.

    Doing this prevents the awkward passing of pointers that is needed when the
    original object in the main thread needs to synchronize with its worker thread
    in its own wxThread derived object.

    For example, wxFrame may need to make some calculations in a background thread
    and then display the results of those calculations in the main window.

    Ordinarily, a wxThread derived object would be created with the calculation
    code implemented in wxThread::Entry. To access the inputs to the calculation,
    the frame object would often need to pass a pointer to itself to the thread object.
    Similarly, the frame object would hold a pointer to the thread object.

    Shared data and synchronization objects could be stored in either object
    though the object without the data would have to access the data through
    a pointer.
    However with wxThreadHelper the frame object and the thread object are
    treated as the same object. Shared data and synchronization variables are
    stored in the single object, eliminating a layer of indirection and the
    associated pointers.

    Example:
    @code
        class MyFrame : public wxFrame, public wxThreadHelper
        {
        public:
            MyFrame(...)
            {
                // It is also possible to use event tables, but dynamic binding is simpler.
                Bind(wxEVT_THREAD, &MyFrame::OnThreadUpdate, this);
            }

            ~MyFrame()
            {
                // it's better to do any thread cleanup in the OnClose()
                // event handler, rather than in the destructor.
                // This is because the event loop for a top-level window is not
                // active anymore when its destructor is called and if the thread
                // sends events when ending, they won't be processed unless
                // you ended the thread from OnClose.
                // See @ref overview_windowdeletion for more info.

    @class wxThread

    A thread is basically a path of execution through a program.
    Threads are sometimes called @e light-weight processes, but the fundamental difference
    between threads and processes is that memory spaces of different processes are
    separated while all threads share the same address space.

    @note In C++11 programs, consider using @c std::thread instead of this class.

    While it makes it much easier to share common data between several threads, it
    also makes it much easier to shoot oneself in the foot, so careful use of
    synchronization objects such as mutexes (see wxMutex) or critical sections
    (see wxCriticalSection) is recommended.
    In addition, don't create global thread objects because they allocate memory
    in their constructor, which will cause problems for the memory checking system.


    @section thread_types Types of wxThreads

    There are two types of threads in wxWidgets: @e detached and @e joinable,
    modeled after the POSIX thread API. This is different from the Win32 API
    where all threads are joinable.

    By default wxThreads in wxWidgets use the @b detached behaviour.
    Detached threads delete themselves once they have completed, either by themselves
    when they complete processing or through a call to Delete(), and thus
    @b must be created on the heap (through the new operator, for example).

    Typically you'll want to store the instances of the detached wxThreads you
    allocate, so that you can call functions on them.
    Because of their nature however you'll need to always use a critical section
    when accessing them:

    @code
    // declare a new type of event, to be used by our MyThread class:
    wxDECLARE_EVENT(wxEVT_COMMAND_MYTHREAD_COMPLETED, wxThreadEvent);
    wxDECLARE_EVENT(wxEVT_COMMAND_MYTHREAD_UPDATE, wxThreadEvent);

            // event handler, rather than in the destructor.
            // This is because the event loop for a top-level window is not
            // active anymore when its destructor is called and if the thread
            // sends events when ending, they won't be processed unless
            // you ended the thread from OnClose.

    @endcode

    For a more detailed and comprehensive example, see @sample{thread}.
    For a simpler way to share data and synchronization objects between
    the main and the secondary thread see wxThreadHelper.

    Conversely, @b joinable threads do not delete themselves when they are done
    processing and as such are safe to create on the stack. Joinable threads
    also provide the ability for one to get value it returned from Entry()
    through Wait().
    You shouldn't hurry to create all the threads joinable, however, because this
    has a disadvantage as well: you @b must Wait() for a joinable thread or the
    system resources used by it will never be freed, and you also must delete the
    corresponding wxThread object yourself if you did not create it on the stack.
    In contrast, detached threads are of the "fire-and-forget" kind: you only have
    to start a detached thread and it will terminate and destroy itself.


    @section thread_deletion wxThread Deletion

    Regardless of whether it has terminated or not, you should call Wait() on a
    @b joinable thread to release its memory, as outlined in @ref thread_types.
    If you created a joinable thread on the heap, remember to delete it manually
    with the @c delete operator or similar means as only detached threads handle
    this type of memory management.

    Since @b detached threads delete themselves when they are finished processing,
    you should take care when calling a routine on one. If you are certain the
    thread is still running and would like to end it, you may call Delete()
    to gracefully end it (which implies that the thread will be deleted after
    that call to Delete()). It should be implied that you should @b never attempt
    to delete a detached thread with the @c delete operator or similar means.

    As mentioned, Wait() or Delete() functions attempt to gracefully terminate a
    joinable and a detached thread, respectively. They do this by waiting until
    the thread in question calls TestDestroy() or ends processing (i.e. returns
    from wxThread::Entry).

    Obviously, if the thread does call TestDestroy() and does not end, the
    thread which called Wait() or Delete() will come to halt.
    This is why it's important to call TestDestroy() in the Entry() routine of
    your threads as often as possible and immediately exit when it returns @true.

    As a last resort you can end the thread immediately through Kill(). It is
    strongly recommended that you do not do this, however, as it does not free
    the resources associated with the object (although the wxThread object of
    detached threads will still be deleted) and could leave the C runtime
    library in an undefined state.


    @section thread_secondary wxWidgets Calls in Secondary Threads

    All threads other than the "main application thread" (the one running
    wxApp::OnInit() or the one your main function runs in, for example) are
    considered "secondary threads".

    GUI calls, such as those to a wxWindow or wxBitmap are explicitly not safe
    at all in secondary threads and could end your application prematurely.
    This is due to several reasons, including the underlying native API and
    the fact that wxThread does not run a GUI event loop similar to other APIs
    as MFC.

    A workaround for some wxWidgets ports is calling wxMutexGUIEnter()
    before any GUI calls and then calling wxMutexGUILeave() afterwords.
    However, the recommended way is to simply process the GUI calls in the main
    thread through an event that is posted by wxQueueEvent().
    This does not imply that calls to these classes are thread-safe, however,
    as most wxWidgets classes are not thread-safe, including wxString.


    @section thread_poll Don't Poll a wxThread

    A common problem users experience with wxThread is that in their main thread
    they will check the thread every now and then to see if it has ended through
    IsRunning(), only to find that their application has run into problems
    because the thread is using the default behaviour (i.e. it's @b detached) and
    has already deleted itself.
    Naturally, they instead attempt to use joinable threads in place of the previous
    behaviour. However, polling a wxThread for when it has ended is in general a
    bad idea - in fact calling a routine on any running wxThread should be avoided
    if possible. Instead, find a way to notify yourself when the thread has ended.

    Usually you only need to notify the main thread, in which case you can
    post an event to it via wxQueueEvent().
    In the case of secondary threads you can call a routine of another class
    when the thread is about to complete processing and/or set the value of
    a variable, possibly using mutexes (see wxMutex) and/or other synchronization
    means if necessary.

        causing huge performance issues for your application.

        <strong>
        With a well-behaving, CPU-efficient thread the operating system is likely
        to properly care for its reactivation the moment it needs it, whereas with
        non-deterministic, Yield-using threads all bets are off and the system
        scheduler is free to penalize them drastically</strong>, and this effect
        gets worse with increasing system load due to less free CPU resources available.

    wxSemaphore is a counter limiting the number of threads concurrently accessing

    specified during the semaphore creation. When the counter is strictly greater
    than 0, a call to wxSemaphore::Wait() returns immediately and decrements the
    counter. As soon as it reaches 0, any subsequent calls to wxSemaphore::Wait
    block and only return when the semaphore counter becomes strictly positive
    again as the result of calling wxSemaphore::Post which increments the counter.

    In general, semaphores are useful to restrict access to a shared resource
    which can only be accessed by some fixed number of clients at the same time.
    For example, when modeling a hotel reservation system a semaphore with the counter
    equal to the total number of available rooms could be created. Each time a room
    is reserved, the semaphore should be acquired by calling wxSemaphore::Wait
    and each time a room is freed it should be released by calling wxSemaphore::Post.

/**
    @class wxMutex

    A mutex object is a synchronization object whose state is set to signaled when
    it is not owned by any thread, and nonsignaled when it is owned. Its name comes
    from its usefulness in coordinating mutually-exclusive access to a shared
    resource as only one thread at a time can own a mutex object.

    @note In C++11 programs, prefer using @c std::mutex to this class.

    Mutexes may be recursive in the sense that a thread can lock a mutex which it
    had already locked before (instead of dead locking the entire process in this
    situation by starting to wait on a mutex which will never be released while the
    thread is waiting) but using them is not recommended under Unix and they are
    @b not recursive by default. The reason for this is that recursive
    mutexes are not supported by all Unix flavours and, worse, they cannot be used
    with wxCondition.

    For example, when several threads use the data stored in the linked list,
    modifications to the list should only be allowed to one thread at a time
    because during a new node addition the list integrity is temporarily broken
    (this is also called @e program @e invariant).

    @code
    // this variable has an "s_" prefix because it is static: seeing an "s_" in
    // a multithreaded program is in general a good sign that you should use a
    // mutex (or a critical section)
    static wxMutex s_mutexProtectingTheGlobalData;

    // we store some numbers in this global array which is presumably used by
    // several threads simultaneously
    wxArrayInt s_data;

    void MyThread::AddNewNode(int num)
    {
        // ensure that no other thread accesses the list

        // Note that using Lock() and Unlock() explicitly is not recommended
        // and only done here for illustrative purposes, prefer to use
        // wxMutexLocker, as shown below, instead!
        s_mutexProtectingTheGlobalData.Lock();

        s_data.Add(num);

        s_mutexProtectingTheGlobaData.Unlock();
    }

    // return true if the given number is greater than all array elements
    bool MyThread::IsGreater(int num)
    {
        // before using the list we must acquire the mutex
        wxMutexLocker lock(s_mutexProtectingTheGlobalData);

        size_t count = s_data.Count();
        for ( size_t n = 0; n < count; n++ )
        {
            if ( s_data[n] > num )
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
    @endcode

    Notice how wxMutexLocker was used in the second function to ensure that the
    mutex is unlocked in any case: whether the function returns true or false
    (because the destructor of the local object @e lock is always called).
    Using this class instead of directly using wxMutex is, in general, safer
    and is even more so if your program uses C++ exceptions.
