/**
    Query and modify locale used for the UI by the current platform.

    UI locale determines all culture-dependent conventions used in the user
    interface, including numbers, currencies and dates formatting. It also
    determines the language used by the native dialogs, such as wxFileDialog,
    where different labels use the language corresponding to the current UI
    locale.

    The UI locale is, in general, different from C locale set by the standard
    @c setlocale() function and affecting C standard library functions such as
    @c printf(), @c scanf(), @c strftime() and many others. Unfortunately, the
    relationship between C and UI locales is not the same depending on the
    platform: with wxGTK they must be the same, but under macOS C locale must
    not be changed, as doing this exposes bugs in the system. Because of this,
    applications can't generally count on C locale being set to any particular
    value and it is best to avoid using it, including implicitly via the
    standard C functions, in portable code. Instead, consider using
    wxNumberFormatter for parsing and formatting numbers according to the
    current UI locale or wxString::FromCDouble() and wxString::ToCDouble()
    functions for doing it always using period as decimal separator.

    Localized applications should call wxUILocale::UseDefault() on startup to
    explicitly indicate that they opt-in using the current UI locale, even if
    this results in changing the global C locale, as is the case in wxGTK. Note
    that some platforms (MSW and macOS) will use default user locale for their
    standard dialogs even if this function is not called, but it is still
    necessary to call it to use the correct number and date formats and to
    avoid mixing messages in the user language with default formats not
    corresponding to it.

    Please also note that under macOS to really use the user locale, it must be
    listed as a supported language in the application @c Info.plist file under
    @c CFBundleLocalizations key.

    Unlike wxLocale class, this class doesn't affect the translations used by
    the application, see wxTranslations for doing this.

/**
    Represents a locale in a portable way.

    There are two possible ways to construct wxLocaleIdent:

    - You can either use FromTag() to create it from a string in the form
      `language ["-" script] ["-" region]`, corresponding to
      the subset of BCP 47 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt)
      syntax.
    - Or you can create it from the different parts of this string by using
      the default constructor and then chaining calls to Language(),
      Region(), Script() and other methods.

    The first method is useful for interoperating with the other software using
    BCP 47 language tags, while the second one may may result in more readable
    code and allows to specify Unix-specific locale description parts such as
    charset and modifier that are not part of the BCP 47 strings.

    Example of using wxLocaleIdent in the second way:
    @code
      auto loc = wxLocaleIdent().Language("fr").Region("BE").Modifier("euro");
    #if defined(__WINDOWS__) || defined(__WXOSX__)
      wxASSERT( loc.GetName() == "fr_BE" );
    #elif defined(__UNIX__)
      wxASSERT( loc.GetName() == "fr_BE@euro" );
    #endif
    @endcode

    For the first way, it is enough to just write
    @code
      auto loc = wxLocaleIdent::FromTag("fr-BE"); // Dash, not underscore!
    @endcode

    @since 3.1.6
*/
class wxLocaleIdent
{
public:
    /**
        Return the locale identifier corresponding to the given locale tag.

        This method accepts locale tags in various formats:

        - BCP-47,
        - Windows,
        - POSIX,
        - macOS. and
        - MSVC CRT.

        See section 2.01 of https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt for the
        full BCP-47 syntax. Here we fully support just the subset we're interested in:

        - Normal language tags (not private use or grandfathered ones),
        - Script, and
        - Region.

        Additionally platform-specific tags are supported:

        - Extensions (without validity checks) (Windows only),
        - Sortorder (Windows only)
        - Charset (POSIX only), and
        - Modifier (POSIX only).

        Only language, script, and region are supported across all platforms.
        The script tag is mapped to the modifier tag for POSIX platforms.
        The script tag takes precedence, if a modifier is also specified.

        The following tag syntax is accepted:

        - BCP-47:   \<language\>[-\<script\>][-\<region\>][-\<extension\>]
        - Windows:  \<language\>[-\<script\>][-\<region\>][-\<extension\>][_\<sortorder\>]
        - POSIX:    \<language\>[_\<region\>][.\<charset\>][@@\<modifier\>]
        - macOS:    \<language\>[-\<script\>][_\<region\>]
        - MSVC CRT: \<language\>[_\<region\>][.\<charset\>]

        The string must contain at least the language part (2 or 3 ASCII
        letters) and may contain script and region separated by dashes, i.e.
        all of the following are valid:

        - "mn"
        - "mn-MN"
        - "mn-Cyrl-MN"

        Note that while BCP 47 extlangs, variants, extensions, private use and
        grandfathered tags are currently not directly supported, they may still
        work for creating wxUILocale on platforms with native support for BCP
        47 strings.

        If the input argument uses an unrecognized syntax (e.g. is empty), an
        empty wxLocaleIdent is returned. Of course, even if this function
        returns a non-empty object, the resulting locale may still be invalid
        or unsupported, use wxUILocale::IsSupported() to check for this.

        Note that the format "MSVC CRT" (Microsoft Visual C++ C RunTime) is
        only supported as an input format, so that locale names as returned
        by the CRT function setlocale can be handled, mainly for compatibility
        with wxLocale.
