/**
    @class wxFFile

    wxFFile implements buffered file I/O.

    This is a very small class designed to minimize the overhead of using it - in fact,
    there is hardly any overhead at all, but using it brings you automatic error checking
    and hides differences between platforms and compilers.

    It wraps inside it a @c FILE * handle used by standard C IO library (also known as @c stdio).
