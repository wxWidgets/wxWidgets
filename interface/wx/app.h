    @class wxAppConsole

    This class is essential for writing console-only or hybrid apps without
    having to define @c wxUSE_GUI=0.

    It is used to:
    @li set and get application-wide properties (see wxAppConsole::CreateTraits
        and wxAppConsole::SetXXX functions)
    @li implement the windowing system message or event loop: events in fact are
        supported even in console-mode applications (see wxAppConsole::HandleEvent
        and wxAppConsole::ProcessPendingEvents);
    @li initiate application processing via wxApp::OnInit;
    @li allow default processing of events not handled by other
        objects in the application (see wxAppConsole::FilterEvent)
    @li implement Apple-specific event handlers (see wxAppConsole::MacXXX functions)

    You should use the macro wxIMPLEMENT_APP(appClass) in your application
    implementation file to tell wxWidgets how to create an instance of your
    application class.

    Use wxDECLARE_APP(appClass) in a header file if you want the ::wxGetApp() function
    (which returns a reference to your application object) to be visible to other
    files.
