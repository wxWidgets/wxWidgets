/**
    @class wxFileName

    wxFileName encapsulates a file name.

    This class serves two purposes: first, it provides the functions to split the
    file names into components and to recombine these components in the full file
    name which can then be passed to the OS file functions
    (and @ref group_funcmacro_file "wxWidgets functions" wrapping them).
    Second, it includes the functions for working with the files itself. Note that
    to change the file data you should use wxFile class instead.
    wxFileName provides functions for working with the file attributes.

    When working with directory names (i.e. without filename and extension)
    make sure not to misuse the file name part of this class with the last
    directory. Instead initialize the wxFileName instance like this:

    @code
    wxFileName dirname( "C:\mydir", "" );
    MyMethod( dirname.GetPath() );
    @endcode

    The same can be done using the static method wxFileName::DirName():

    @code
    wxFileName dirname = wxFileName::DirName( "C:\mydir" );
    MyMethod( dirname.GetPath() );
    @endcode

    Accordingly, methods dealing with directories or directory names like
    wxFileName::IsDirReadable() use wxFileName::GetPath() whereas methods dealing
    with file names like wxFileName::IsFileReadable() use wxFileName::GetFullPath().

    If it is not known whether a string contains a directory name or a complete
    file name (such as when interpreting user input) you need to use the static
    function wxFileName::DirExists() (or its identical variants wxDir::Exists() and
    wxDirExists()) and construct the wxFileName instance accordingly.
    This will only work if the directory actually exists, of course:

    @code
    wxString user_input;
    // get input from user

    wxFileName fname;
    if (wxDirExists(user_input))
        fname.AssignDir( user_input );
    else
        fname.Assign( user_input );
    @endcode

    Please note that many wxFileName methods accept the path format argument
    which is by @c wxPATH_NATIVE by default meaning to use the path format
    native for the current platform.
    The path format affects the operation of wxFileName functions in several ways:
    first and foremost, it defines the path separator character to use, but it
    also affects other things such as whether the path has the drive part or not.
    See wxPathFormat for more info.


    @section filename_format File name format

    wxFileName currently supports the file names in the Unix, DOS/Windows,
    Mac OS and VMS formats. Although these formats are quite different,
    wxFileName tries to treat them all in the same generic way.
    It supposes that all file names consist of the following parts: the volume
    (also known as drive under Windows or device under VMS), the path which is
    a sequence of directory names separated by the path separators and the full
    filename itself which, in turn, is composed from the base file name and the
    extension. All of the individual components of the file name may be empty
    and, for example, the volume name is always empty under Unix, but if they
    are all empty simultaneously, the filename object is considered to be in an
    invalid state and wxFileName::IsOk() returns false for it.

    File names can be case-sensitive or not, the function wxFileName::IsCaseSensitive()
    allows determining this. The rules for determining whether the file name is
    absolute or relative also depend on the file name format and the only portable way
    to answer this question is to use wxFileName::IsAbsolute() or wxFileName::IsRelative()
    method.

    Note that on Windows,"X:" refers to the current working directory on drive X.
    Therefore, a wxFileName instance constructed from for example "X:dir/file.ext"
    treats the portion beyond drive separator as being relative to that directory.
    To ensure that the filename is absolute, you may use wxFileName::MakeAbsolute().
    There is also an inverse function wxFileName::MakeRelativeTo() which undoes
    what wxFileName::Normalize(wxPATH_NORM_DOTS) does.
    Other functions returning information about the file format provided by this
    class are wxFileName::GetVolumeSeparator(), wxFileName::IsPathSeparator().


    @section filename_construction File name construction

    You can initialize a wxFileName instance using one of the following functions:

    @li wxFileName::wxFileName()
    @li wxFileName::Assign()
    @li wxFileName::AssignCwd()
    @li wxFileName::AssignDir()
    @li wxFileName::AssignHomeDir()
    @li wxFileName::AssignTempFileName()
    @li wxFileName::DirName()
    @li wxFileName::FileName()
    @li wxFileName::operator=()


    @section filename_tests File name tests

    Before doing other tests, you should use wxFileName::IsOk() to verify that
    the filename is well defined. If it is, FileExists() can be used to test whether
    a file with such name exists and wxFileName::DirExists() can be used to test
    for directory existence.
    File names should be compared using the wxFileName::SameAs() method or
    wxFileName::operator==(). For testing basic access modes, you can use:

    @li wxFileName::IsDirWritable()
    @li wxFileName::IsDirReadable()
    @li wxFileName::IsFileWritable()
    @li wxFileName::IsFileReadable()
    @li wxFileName::IsFileExecutable()


    @section filename_components File name components

    These functions allow to examine and modify the individual directories
    of the path:

    @li wxFileName::AppendDir()
    @li wxFileName::InsertDir()
    @li wxFileName::GetDirCount()
    @li wxFileName::PrependDir()
    @li wxFileName::RemoveDir()
    @li wxFileName::RemoveLastDir()

    To change the components of the file name individually you can use the
    following functions:

    @li wxFileName::GetExt()
    @li wxFileName::GetName()
    @li wxFileName::GetVolume()
    @li wxFileName::HasExt()
    @li wxFileName::HasName()
    @li wxFileName::HasVolume()
    @li wxFileName::SetExt()
    @li wxFileName::ClearExt()
    @li wxFileName::SetEmptyExt()
    @li wxFileName::SetName()
    @li wxFileName::SetVolume()


    @section filename_operations File name operations

    These methods allow to work with the file creation, access and modification
    times. Note that not all filesystems under all platforms implement these times
    in the same way. For example, the access time under Windows has a resolution of
    one day (so it is really the access date and not time). The access time may be
    updated when the file is executed or not depending on the platform.

    @li wxFileName::GetModificationTime()
    @li wxFileName::GetTimes()
    @li wxFileName::SetTimes()
    @li wxFileName::Touch()

    Other file system operations functions are:

    @li wxFileName::Mkdir()
    @li wxFileName::Rmdir()

    @section symlink_behavior Behavior with symlinks

    wxFileName instances can store the path to symlinks on systems that support them.
    When the path is for a symlink, the behavior of the following methods can be modified
    to either operate on the symlink itself or on the file the link points to.

    @li wxFileName::FileExists()
    @li wxFileName::DirExists()
    @li wxFileName::Exists()
    @li wxFileName::SameAs()
    @li wxFileName::GetTimes()

    By default, those functions will operate on the target of the link, but they can be
    made to operate on the link itself by calling wxFileName::DontFollowLink(). The current
    link-following mode can be examined by calling wxFileName::ShouldFollowLink().

    The wxFileName::ResolveLink() method can be used to get the absolute path for the target
    of the symlink.

        In the first version, the size of this file is used. In the second one,
        the specified size @a bytes is used.

        If the file size could not be retrieved or @a bytes is ::wxInvalidSize
        or zero, the @c failmsg string is returned.

        Otherwise the returned string is a floating-point number with @c
        precision decimal digits followed by the abbreviation of the unit used.
        By default the traditional, although incorrect, convention of using SI
        units for multiples of 1024 is used, i.e. returned string will use
        suffixes of B, KB, MB, GB, TB for bytes, kilobytes, megabytes,
        gigabytes and terabytes respectively. With the IEC convention the names
        of the units are changed to B, KiB, MiB, GiB and TiB for bytes,
        kibibytes, mebibytes, gibibytes and tebibytes. Finally, with SI
        convention the same B, KB, MB, GB and TB suffixes are used but in their
        correct SI meaning, i.e. as multiples of 1000 and not 1024.

        Support for the different size conventions is new in wxWidgets 2.9.1,
        in previous versions only the traditional convention was implemented.
