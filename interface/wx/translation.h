/**
    This class allows to get translations for strings.

    In wxWidgets this class manages message catalogs which contain the
    translations of the strings used to the current language. Unlike wxLocale,
    it isn't bound to locale. It can be used either independently of, or in
    conjunction with wxLocale. In the latter case, you should initialize
    wxLocale (which creates wxTranslations instance) first; in the former, you
    need to create a wxTranslations object and Set() it manually.

    Only one wxTranslations instance is active at a time; it is set with the
    Set() method and obtained using Get().

    Unlike wxLocale, wxTranslations' primary mean of identifying language
    is by its "canonical name", i.e. ISO 639 code, possibly combined with
    ISO 3166 country code and additional modifiers (examples include
    "fr", "en_GB" or "ca@valencia"; see wxLocale::GetCanonicalName() for
    more information). This allows apps using wxTranslations API to use even
    languages not recognized by the operating system or not listed in
    wxLanguage enum.

    This macro doesn't do anything in the program code -- it simply expands to

    this is achieved using _() but that macro not only marks the string for
    extraction but also expands into a wxGetTranslation() call which means that
    it cannot be used in some situations, notably for static array
    initialization.

    Here is an example which should make it more clear: suppose that you have a
    static array of strings containing the weekday names and which have to be
    translated (note that it is a bad example, really, as wxDateTime already
    can be used to get the localized week day names already). If you write:
