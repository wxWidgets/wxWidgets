/**
    @class wxLayoutAlgorithm

    wxLayoutAlgorithm implements layout of subwindows in MDI or SDI frames.
    It sends a wxCalculateLayoutEvent event to children of the frame, asking them
    for information about their size. For MDI parent frames, the algorithm allocates
    the remaining space to the MDI client window (which contains the MDI child frames).

    For SDI (normal) frames, a 'main' window is specified as taking up the
    remaining space.

    Because the event system is used, this technique can be applied to any windows,
    which are not necessarily 'aware' of the layout classes (no virtual functions
    in wxWindow refer to wxLayoutAlgorithm or its events).
    However, you may wish to use wxSashLayoutWindow for your subwindows since this
    class provides handlers for the required events, and accessors to specify the
    desired size of the window. The sash behaviour in the base class can be used,
    optionally, to make the windows user-resizable.

    wxLayoutAlgorithm is typically used in IDE (integrated development environment)
    applications, where there are several resizable windows in addition to the MDI
    client window, or other primary editing window. Resizable windows might include
    toolbars, a project window, and a window for displaying error and warning messages.

    When a window receives an OnCalculateLayout event, it should call SetRect in
    the given event object, to be the old supplied rectangle minus whatever space
    the window takes up. It should also set its own size accordingly.
    wxSashLayoutWindow::OnCalculateLayout generates an OnQueryLayoutInfo event
    which it sends to itself to determine the orientation, alignment and size of
    the window, which it gets from internal member variables set by the application.

    The algorithm works by starting off with a rectangle equal to the whole frame
    client area. It iterates through the frame children, generating
    wxLayoutAlgorithm::OnCalculateLayout events which subtract the window size and
    return the remaining rectangle for the next window to process.
    It is assumed (by wxSashLayoutWindow::OnCalculateLayout) that a window stretches
    the full dimension of the frame client, according to the orientation it specifies.
    For example, a horizontal window will stretch the full width of the remaining
    portion of the frame client area.
    In the other orientation, the window will be fixed to whatever size was
    specified by wxLayoutAlgorithm::OnQueryLayoutInfo. An alignment setting will
    make the window 'stick' to the left, top, right or bottom of the remaining
    client area. This scheme implies that order of window creation is important.
    Say you wish to have an extra toolbar at the top of the frame, a project window
    to the left of the MDI client window, and an output window above the status bar.
    You should therefore create the windows in this order: toolbar, output window,
    project window. This ensures that the toolbar and output window take up space
    at the top and bottom, and then the remaining height in-between is used for
    the project window.

    wxLayoutAlgorithm is quite independent of the way in which
    wxLayoutAlgorithm::OnCalculateLayout chooses to interpret a window's size and
    alignment. Therefore you could implement a different window class with a new
    wxLayoutAlgorithm::OnCalculateLayout event handler, that has a more sophisticated
    way of laying out the windows. It might allow specification of whether stretching
    occurs in the specified orientation, for example, rather than always assuming
    stretching.
    (This could, and probably should, be added to the existing implementation).

    @note wxLayoutAlgorithm has nothing to do with wxLayoutConstraints.
          It is an alternative way of specifying layouts for which the normal
          constraint system is unsuitable.

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxQueryLayoutInfoEvent,wxCalculateLayoutEvent}
    @event{EVT_QUERY_LAYOUT_INFO(func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_QUERY_LAYOUT_INFO event, to get size, orientation and
        alignment from a window. See wxQueryLayoutInfoEvent.
    @event{EVT_CALCULATE_LAYOUT(func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_CALCULATE_LAYOUT event, which asks the window to take a
        'bite' out of a rectangle provided by the algorithm. See wxCalculateLayoutEvent.
    @endEventTable

    Note that the algorithm object does not respond to events, but itself generates the
    previous events in order to calculate window sizes.

/**
    @class wxSashLayoutWindow

    wxSashLayoutWindow responds to OnCalculateLayout events generated by wxLayoutAlgorithm.
    It allows the  application to use simple accessors to specify how the window
    should be laid out, rather than having to respond to events.

    The fact that the class derives from wxSashWindow allows sashes to be used if
    required, to allow the windows to be user-resizable.

    The documentation for wxLayoutAlgorithm explains the purpose of this class in
    more detail.

    For the window styles see wxSashWindow.

    This class handles the EVT_QUERY_LAYOUT_INFO and EVT_CALCULATE_LAYOUT events
    for you. However, if you use sashes, see wxSashWindow for relevant event information.
    See also wxLayoutAlgorithm for information about the layout events.
