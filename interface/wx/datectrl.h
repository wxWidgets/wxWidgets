/**
    @class wxDatePickerCtrl

    This control allows the user to select a date. Unlike wxCalendarCtrl, which
    is a relatively big control, wxDatePickerCtrl is implemented as a small
    window showing the currently selected date. The control can be edited using
    the keyboard, and can also display a popup window for more user-friendly
    date selection, depending on the styles used and the platform.

    It is only available if @c wxUSE_DATEPICKCTRL is set to 1.

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxDP_SPIN}
           Creates a control without a month calendar drop down but with
           spin-control-like arrows to change individual date components. This
           style is not supported by the generic version.
    @style{wxDP_DROPDOWN}
           Creates a control with a month calendar drop-down part from which
           the user can select a date. This style is not supported in OSX/Cocoa
           native version.
    @style{wxDP_DEFAULT}
           Creates a control with the style that is best supported for the
           current platform (currently wxDP_SPIN under Windows and OSX/Cocoa
           and wxDP_DROPDOWN elsewhere).
    @style{wxDP_ALLOWNONE}
           With this style, the control allows the user to not enter any valid
           date at all. Without it - the default - the control always has some
           valid date. This style is not supported in OSX/Cocoa native version.
    @style{wxDP_SHOWCENTURY}
           Forces display of the century in the default date format. Without
           this style the century could be displayed, or not, depending on the
           default date representation in the system. This style is not
           supported in OSX/Cocoa native version currently.
    @endStyleTable

    As can be seen from the remarks above, most of the control style are only
    supported in the native MSW implementation. In portable code it's
    recommended to use @c wxDP_DEFAULT style only, possibly combined with @c
    wxDP_SHOWCENTURY (this is also the style used by default if none is
    specified).

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxDateEvent}
    @event{EVT_DATE_CHANGED(id, func)}
           Process a wxEVT_DATE_CHANGED event, which fires when the user
           changes the current selection in the control.

            and width large enough to show the date string fully.
