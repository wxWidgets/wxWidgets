    @class wxGLContext

    An instance of a wxGLContext represents the state of an OpenGL state
    machine and the connection between OpenGL and the system.

    The OpenGL state includes everything that can be set with the OpenGL API:
    colors, rendering variables, display lists, texture objects, etc. Although
    it is possible to have multiple rendering contexts share display lists in
    order to save resources, this method is hardly used today any more, because
    display lists are only a tiny fraction of the overall state.

    Therefore, one rendering context is usually used with or bound to multiple
    output windows in turn, so that the application has access to the complete
    and identical state while rendering into each window.

    Binding (making current) a rendering context with another instance of a
    wxGLCanvas however works only if the other wxGLCanvas was created with the
    same attributes as the wxGLCanvas from which the wxGLContext was
    initialized. (This applies to sharing display lists among contexts
    analogously.)

    Note that some wxGLContext features are extremely platform-specific - its
    best to check your native platform's glcanvas header (on windows
    include/wx/msw/glcanvas.h) to see what features your native platform
    provides.
    
    wxHAS_OPENGL_ES is defined on platforms that only have this implementation
    available (eg the iPhone) und don't support the full specification.

/**
    @class wxGLCanvas

    wxGLCanvas is a class for displaying OpenGL graphics. It is always used in
    conjunction with wxGLContext as the context can only be made current (i.e.
    active for the OpenGL commands) when it is associated to a wxGLCanvas.

    More precisely, you first need to create a wxGLCanvas window and then
    create an instance of a wxGLContext that is initialized with this
    wxGLCanvas and then later use either SetCurrent() with the instance of the
    wxGLContext or wxGLContext::SetCurrent() with the instance of the
    wxGLCanvas (which might be not the same as was used for the creation of the
    context) to bind the OpenGL state that is represented by the rendering
    context to the canvas, and then finally call SwapBuffers() to swap the
    buffers of the OpenGL canvas and thus show your current output.

    Notice that versions of wxWidgets previous to 2.9 used to implicitly create a
    wxGLContext inside wxGLCanvas itself. This is still supported in the
    current version but is deprecated now and will be removed in the future,
    please update your code to create the rendering contexts explicitly.

    To set up the attributes for the canvas (number of bits for the depth
    buffer, number of bits for the stencil buffer and so on) you should set up
    the correct values of the @e attribList parameter. The values that should
    be set up and their meanings will be described below.

    @note
        On those platforms which use a configure script (e.g. Linux and Mac OS)
        OpenGL support is automatically enabled if the relative headers and
        libraries are found.
        To switch it on under the other platforms (e.g. Windows), you need to edit
        the @c setup.h file and set @c wxUSE_GLCANVAS to @c 1 and then also pass
        @c USE_OPENGL=1 to the make utility. You may also need to add @c opengl32.lib
        and @c glu32.lib to the list of the libraries your program is linked with.

        create and use a wxGLContext to output to this window.

        If @a attribList is not specified, double buffered RGBA mode is used.

        @param parent
            Pointer to a parent window.
        @param id
            Window identifier. If -1, will automatically create an identifier.
        @param pos
            Window position. wxDefaultPosition is (-1, -1) which indicates that
            wxWidgets should generate a default position for the window.
        @param size

            wxWidgets should generate a default size for the window. If no
            suitable size can be found, the window will be sized to 20x20

            Array of integers. With this parameter you can set the device
            context attributes associated to this window. This array is
            zero-terminated: it should be set up using @ref wxGL_FLAGS
            constants. If a constant should be followed by a value, put it in
            the next array position. For example, WX_GL_DEPTH_SIZE should be
            followed by the value that indicates the number of bits for the
            depth buffer, e.g.:
            @code
            attribList[n++] = WX_GL_DEPTH_SIZE;
            attribList[n++] = 32;
            attribList[n] = 0; // terminate the list
            @endcode
            If the attribute list is not specified at all, i.e. if this
            parameter is @NULL, the default attributes including WX_GL_RGBA and
            WX_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER are used. But notice that if you do specify some
            attributes you also need to explicitly include these two default
            attributes in the list if you need them.
