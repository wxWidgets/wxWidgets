    @class wxBusyInfo

    This class makes it easy to tell your user that the program is temporarily busy.

    Normally the main thread should always return to the main loop to continue
    dispatching events as quickly as possible, hence this class shouldn't be
    needed. However if the main thread does need to block, this class provides
    a simple way to at least show this to the user: just create a wxBusyInfo
    object on the stack, and within the current scope, a message window will be
    shown.

    For example:

    @code
        wxBusyInfo wait("Please wait, working...");

        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
        {
            DoACalculation();
        }
    @endcode

    It works by creating a window in the constructor, and deleting it
    in the destructor.

    This window is rather plain by default but can be customized by passing
    wxBusyInfo constructor an object of wxBusyInfoFlags class instead of a
    simple message. Here is an example from the dialogs sample:

    @code
        wxBusyInfo info
            (
                wxBusyInfoFlags()
                    .Parent(this)
                    .Icon(wxArtProvider::GetIcon(wxART_PRINT,
                                                 wxART_OTHER, wxSize(128, 128)))
                    .Title("<b>Printing your document</b>")
                    .Text("Please wait...")
                    .Foreground(*wxWHITE)
                    .Background(*wxBLACK)
                    .Transparency(4*wxALPHA_OPAQUE/5)
            );
    @endcode

    This shows that separate title and text can be set, and that simple markup
    (@ref wxControl::SetLabelMarkup()) can be used in them, and that it's also
    possible to add an icon and customize the colours and transparency of the
    window.

    You may also want to call wxTheApp->Yield() to refresh the window
    periodically (in case it had been obscured by other windows, for
    example) like this:

    @code
        wxWindowDisabler disableAll;
        wxBusyInfo wait("Please wait, working...");

        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
        {
            DoACalculation();

            if ( !(i % 1000) )
                wxTheApp->Yield();
        }
    @endcode

    but take care to not cause undesirable reentrancies when doing it (see
    wxApp::Yield for more details). The simplest way to do it is to use
    wxWindowDisabler class as illustrated in the above example.

    Note that a wxBusyInfo is always built with the @c wxSTAY_ON_TOP window style
    (see wxFrame window styles for more info).

    This class exists only in order to make passing attributes to wxBusyInfo
    constructor easier and the code doing it more readable.

    All methods of this class return the reference to the object on which they
    are called, making it possible to chain them together, e.g. typically you
    would just create a temporary wxBusyInfoFlags object and then call the
    methods corresponding to the attributes you want to set, before finally
    passing the result to wxBusyInfo constructor, e.g.:
    @code
        wxBusyInfo info
            (
                wxBusyInfoFlags()
                    .Parent(window)
                    .Icon(icon)
                    .Title("Some text")
                    .Text("Some more text")
                    .Foreground(wxColour(...))
