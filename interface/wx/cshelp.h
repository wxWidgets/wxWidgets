/**
    @class wxHelpControllerHelpProvider

    wxHelpControllerHelpProvider is an implementation of wxHelpProvider which
    supports both context identifiers and plain text help strings. If the help
    text is an integer, it is passed to wxHelpController::DisplayContextPopup().
    Otherwise, it shows the string in a tooltip as per wxSimpleHelpProvider. If
    you use this with a wxCHMHelpController instance on windows, it will use
    the native style of tip window instead of wxTipWindow.

    You can use the convenience function wxContextId() to convert an integer
    context id to a string for passing to wxWindow::SetHelpText().

    @category{help}

    @see wxHelpProvider, wxSimpleHelpProvider, wxContextHelp,

/**
    @class wxContextHelp

    This class changes the cursor to a query and puts the application into a
    'context-sensitive help mode'.  When the user left-clicks on a window
    within the specified window, a @c wxEVT_HELP event is sent to that control,
    and the application may respond to it by popping up some help.

    For example:
    @code
    wxContextHelp contextHelp(myWindow);
    @endcode

    There are a couple of ways to invoke this behaviour implicitly:

    - Use the wxDIALOG_EX_CONTEXTHELP style for a dialog (Windows only). This
      will put a question mark in the titlebar, and Windows will put the
      application into context-sensitive help mode automatically, with further
      programming.

    - Create a wxContextHelpButton, whose predefined behaviour is
      to create a context help object.  Normally you will write your application
      so that this button is only added to a dialog for non-Windows platforms
      (use wxDIALOG_EX_CONTEXTHELP on Windows).

    Note that on OS X, the cursor does not change when in context-sensitive
    help mode.

    Instances of this class may be used to add a question mark button that when
    pressed, puts the application into context-help mode. It does this by
    creating a wxContextHelp object which itself generates a @c wxEVT_HELP event
    when the user clicks on a window.

    On Windows, you may add a question-mark icon to a dialog by use of the
    wxDIALOG_EX_CONTEXTHELP extra style, but on other platforms you will have
    to add a button explicitly, usually next to OK, Cancel or similar buttons.
