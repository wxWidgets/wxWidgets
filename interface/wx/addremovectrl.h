    Object used to mediate between wxAddRemoveCtrl and the control showing the
    list of items which can be added or removed.

    This is a base class from which custom classes used with
    wxAddRemoveCtrl::SetAdaptor() must be derived. Object of this class are
    typically associated with the control showing the list of items on
    creation, i.e. the derived class constructor would normally take a pointer
    to the control which will be returned from GetItemsCtrl() later.

/**
    @class wxAddRemoveCtrl

    A class adding buttons to add and remove items to a list-like child
    control.

    This class represents a composite control which combines any control
    capable of showing multiple items, such as wxListBox, wxListCtrl,
    wxTreeCtrl, wxDataViewCtrl or a custom control, with two buttons allowing
    to add items and remove items from this list-like control. The advantage of
    using this control instead of just creating and managing the buttons
    directly is that the correct buttons and layout for the current platform
    are used by this class. E.g. the buttons are positioned under the list
    control under OS X and GTK+ but to its right under MSW and the buttons
    themselves use system-specific bitmaps under OS X.

    This class is always used in conjunction with wxAddRemoveAdaptor which is
    used to actually add items to or remove them from the control containing
    the items when the corresponding button is pressed. The
    @ref page_samples_dialogs "dialogs sample" shows how to do it: first you
    need to derive a new class from wxAddRemoveAdaptor and implement its pure
    virtual methods and then you must call SetAdaptor() with a newly allocated
    object of this class. You also must create the control containing the items
    with wxAddRemoveCtrl as parent. Here are the different steps in pseudocode:
    @code
        wxAddRemoveCtrl* ctrl = new wxAddRemoveCtrl(parent);

        // This can be any kind of control for which OnAdd() and OnRemove()
        // below can be made to work.
        wxListBox* lbox = new wxListBox(ctrl, ...);

        class ListBoxAdaptor : public wxAddRemoveAdaptor
        {
        public:
            explicit ListBoxAdaptor(wxListBox* lbox) : m_lbox(lbox) { }

            virtual wxWindow* GetItemsCtrl() const { return m_lbox; }

            virtual bool CanAdd() const { return true; }
            virtual bool CanRemove() const { return m_lbox->GetSelection() != wxNOT_FOUND; }
            virtual void OnAdd() { ... get the new item from user and add it ... }
            virtual void OnRemove() { m_lbox->Delete(m_lbox->GetSelection()); }

        private:
            wxListBox* m_lbox;
        };

        ctrl->SetAdaptor(new ListBoxAdaptor(lbox));
