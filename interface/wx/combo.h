/**
    @class wxComboCtrl

    A combo control is a generic combobox that allows totally custom popup. In
    addition it has other customization features. For instance, position and
    size of the dropdown button can be changed.

    @section comboctrl_custompopup Setting Custom Popup for wxComboCtrl

    wxComboCtrl needs to be told somehow which control to use and this is done
    by SetPopupControl(). However, we need something more than just a wxControl
    in this method as, for example, we need to call
    SetStringValue("initial text value") and wxControl doesn't have such
    method. So we also need a wxComboPopup which is an interface which must be
    implemented by a control to be usable as a popup.

    We couldn't derive wxComboPopup from wxControl as this would make it
    impossible to have a class deriving from a wxWidgets control and from it,
    so instead it is just a mix-in.

    Here's a minimal sample of wxListView popup:

    @code
    #include <wx/combo.h>
    #include <wx/listctrl.h>

    class wxListViewComboPopup : public wxListView, public wxComboPopup
    {
    public:
        // Initialize member variables
        virtual void Init()
        {
            m_value = -1;
        }

        // Create popup control
        virtual bool Create(wxWindow* parent)
        {
            return wxListView::Create(parent,1,wxPoint(0,0),wxDefaultSize);
        }

        // Return pointer to the created control
        virtual wxWindow *GetControl() { return this; }

        // Translate string into a list selection
        virtual void SetStringValue(const wxString& s)
        {
            int n = wxListView::FindItem(-1,s);
            if ( n >= 0 && n < wxListView::GetItemCount() )
                wxListView::Select(n);
        }

        // Get list selection as a string
        virtual wxString GetStringValue() const
        {
            if ( m_value >= 0 )
            return wxListView::GetItemText(m_value);
            return wxEmptyString;
        }

        // Do mouse hot-tracking (which is typical in list popups)
        void OnMouseMove(wxMouseEvent& event)
        {
            // TODO: Move selection to cursor
        }

        // On mouse left up, set the value and close the popup
        void OnMouseClick(wxMouseEvent& WXUNUSED(event))
        {
            m_value = wxListView::GetFirstSelected();

            // TODO: Send event as well

            Dismiss();
        }

    protected:

        int m_value; // current item index

    private:
        wxDECLARE_EVENT_TABLE();
    };

    wxBEGIN_EVENT_TABLE(wxListViewComboPopup, wxListView)
        EVT_MOTION(wxListViewComboPopup::OnMouseMove)
        EVT_LEFT_UP(wxListViewComboPopup::OnMouseClick)
    wxEND_EVENT_TABLE()
    @endcode

    Here's how you would create and populate it in a dialog constructor:

    @code
    wxComboCtrl* comboCtrl = new wxComboCtrl(this, wxID_ANY, wxEmptyString);

    wxListViewComboPopup* popupCtrl = new wxListViewComboPopup();

    // It is important to call SetPopupControl() as soon as possible
    comboCtrl->SetPopupControl(popupCtrl);

    // Populate using wxListView methods
    popupCtrl->InsertItem(popupCtrl->GetItemCount(), "First Item");
    popupCtrl->InsertItem(popupCtrl->GetItemCount(), "Second Item");
    popupCtrl->InsertItem(popupCtrl->GetItemCount(), "Third Item");
    @endcode

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxCB_READONLY}
           Text will not be editable.
    @style{wxCB_SORT}
           Sorts the entries in the list alphabetically.
    @style{wxTE_PROCESS_ENTER}
           The control will generate the event @c wxEVT_TEXT_ENTER
           (otherwise pressing Enter key is either processed internally by the
           control or used for navigation between dialog controls). Windows
           only.
    @style{wxCC_SPECIAL_DCLICK}
           Double-clicking triggers a call to popup's OnComboDoubleClick.
           Actual behaviour is defined by a derived class. For instance,
           wxOwnerDrawnComboBox will cycle an item. This style only applies if
           wxCB_READONLY is used as well.
    @style{wxCC_STD_BUTTON}
           Drop button will behave more like a standard push button.
    @endStyleTable

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxCommandEvent}
    @event{EVT_TEXT(id, func)}
           Process a @c wxEVT_TEXT event, when the text changes.
    @event{EVT_TEXT_ENTER(id, func)}
           Process a @c wxEVT_TEXT_ENTER event, when RETURN is pressed in
           the combo control.
    @event{EVT_COMBOBOX_DROPDOWN(id, func)}
           Process a @c wxEVT_COMBOBOX_DROPDOWN event, which is generated
           when the popup window is shown (drops down).
    @event{EVT_COMBOBOX_CLOSEUP(id, func)}
           Process a @c wxEVT_COMBOBOX_CLOSEUP event, which is generated
           when the popup window of the combo control disappears (closes up).
           You should avoid adding or deleting items in this event.

        By default, combo controls without @c wxCB_READONLY style create a
        wxTextCtrl which shows the current value and allows to edit it. This
        method allows to use some other window instead of this wxTextCtrl.

        This method can be called after creating the combo fully, however in
        this case a wxTextCtrl is unnecessarily created just to be immediately
        destroyed when it's replaced by a custom window. If you wish to avoid
        this, you can use the following approach, also shown in the combo
        sample:

        @code
            // Create the combo control using its default ctor.
            wxComboCtrl* combo = new wxComboCtrl();

            // Create the custom main control using its default ctor too.
            SomeWindow* main = new SomeWindow();

            // Set the custom main control before creating the combo.
            combo->SetMainControl(main);

            // And only create it now: wxTextCtrl won't be unnecessarily
            // created because the combo already has a main window.
            combo->Create(panel, wxID_ANY, wxEmptyString);

            // Finally create the main window itself, now that its parent was
            // created.
            main->Create(combo, ...);
        @endcode

        Note that when a custom main window is used, none of the methods of
        this class inherited from wxTextEntry, such as SetValue(), Replace(),
        SetInsertionPoint() etc do anything and simply return.
