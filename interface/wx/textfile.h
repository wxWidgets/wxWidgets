    @class wxTextFile

    The wxTextFile is a simple class which allows to work with text files on line by
    line basis. It also understands the differences in line termination characters
    under different platforms and will not do anything bad to files with "non
    native" line termination sequences - in fact, it can be also used to modify the
    text files and change the line termination characters from one type (say DOS) to
    another (say Unix).

    One word of warning: the class is not at all optimized for big files and thus
    it will load the file entirely into memory when opened. Of course, you should
    not work in this way with large files (as an estimation, anything over 1 Megabyte
    is surely too big for this class). On the other hand, it is not a serious
    limitation for small files like configuration files or program sources
    which are well handled by wxTextFile.

    The typical things you may do with wxTextFile in order are:

    - Create and open it: this is done with either wxTextFile::Create or wxTextFile::Open
      function which opens the file (name may be specified either as the argument to
      these functions or in the constructor), reads its contents in memory (in the
      case of wxTextFile::Open()) and closes it.
    - Work with the lines in the file: this may be done either with "direct
      access" functions like wxTextFile::GetLineCount and wxTextFile::GetLine
      (@e operator[] does exactly the same but looks more like array addressing)
      or with "sequential access" functions which include wxTextFile::GetFirstLine,
      wxTextFile::GetNextLine and also wxTextFile::GetLastLine, wxTextFile::GetPrevLine.
      For the sequential access functions the current line number is maintained: it is
      returned by wxTextFile::GetCurrentLine and may be changed with wxTextFile::GoToLine.
    - Add/remove lines to the file: wxTextFile::AddLine and wxTextFile::InsertLine
      add new lines while wxTextFile::RemoveLine deletes the existing ones.
      wxTextFile::Clear resets the file to empty.
    - Save your changes: notice that the changes you make to the file will @b not be
      saved automatically; calling wxTextFile::Close or doing nothing discards them!
      To save the changes you must explicitly call wxTextFile::Write - here, you may
      also change the line termination type if you wish.
