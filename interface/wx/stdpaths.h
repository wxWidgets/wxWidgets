    @class wxStandardPaths

    wxStandardPaths returns the standard locations in the file system and should be
    used by applications to find their data files in a portable way.

    Note that you must not create objects of class wxStandardPaths directly,
    but use the global standard paths object returned by wxStandardPaths::Get()
    (which can be of a type derived from wxStandardPaths and not of exactly
    this type) and call the methods you need on it. The object returned by
    Get() may be customized by overriding wxAppTraits::GetStandardPaths()
    methods.

    In the description of the methods below, the example return values are given
    for the Unix, Windows and Mac OS X systems, however please note that these are
    just the examples and the actual values may differ. For example, under Windows:
    the system administrator may change the standard directories locations, e.g.
    the Windows directory may be named @c "W:\Win2003" instead of
    the default @c "C:\Windows".

    Notice that in the examples below the string @c appinfo may be either just
    the application name (as returned by wxApp::GetAppName()) or a combination
    of the vendor name (wxApp::GetVendorName()) and the application name, with
    a path separator between them. By default, only the application name is
    used, use UseAppInfo() to change this.

    The other placeholders should be self-explanatory: the string @c username
    should be replaced with the value the name of the currently logged in user.
    and @c prefix is only used under Unix and is @c /usr/local by default but
    may be changed using wxStandardPaths::SetInstallPrefix().

    The directories returned by the methods of this class may or may not exist.
    If they don't exist, it's up to the caller to create them, wxStandardPaths doesn't
    do it.

    Finally note that these functions only work with standardly packaged
    applications. I.e. under Unix you should follow the standard installation
    conventions and under Mac you should create your application bundle according
    to the Apple guidelines. Again, this class doesn't help you to do it.

    This class is MT-safe: its methods may be called concurrently from different
    threads without additional locking.
