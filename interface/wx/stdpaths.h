    @class wxStandardPaths

    wxStandardPaths returns the standard locations in the file system and should be
    used by applications to find their data files in a portable way.

    In the description of the methods below, the example return values are given
    for the Unix, Windows and Mac OS X systems, however please note that these are
    just the examples and the actual values may differ. For example, under Windows:
    the system administrator may change the standard directories locations, i.e.
    the Windows directory may be named @c "W:\Win2003" instead of
    the default @c "C:\Windows".

    Notice that in the examples below the string @c appname may be either just
    the application name (as returned by wxApp::GetAppName()) or a combination
    of the vendor name (wxApp::GetVendorName()) and the application name, with
    a path separator between them. By default, the vendor name is used under
    Windows and OS X but not under other Unix systems, see UseAppInfo().

    The other placeholders should be self-explanatory: the string @c username
    should be replaced with the value the name of the currently logged in user.
    and @c prefix is only used under Unix and is @c /usr/local by default but
    may be changed using wxStandardPaths::SetInstallPrefix().

    The directories returned by the methods of this class may or may not exist.
    If they don't exist, it's up to the caller to create them, wxStandardPaths doesn't
    do it.

    Finally note that these functions only work with standardly packaged
    applications. I.e. under Unix you should follow the standard installation
    conventions and under Mac you should create your application bundle according
    to the Apple guidelines. Again, this class doesn't help you to do it.

    This class is MT-safe: its methods may be called concurrently from different
    threads without additional locking.

    Note that you don't allocate an instance of class wxStandardPaths, but retrieve the
    global standard paths object using @c wxStandardPaths::Get on which you call the
    desired methods.

        the main program directory, e.g. this happens in at least the following
        common cases:
         - The program is in "bin" subdirectory of the installation directory.

        cases above but that each call will only remove the last path component.
