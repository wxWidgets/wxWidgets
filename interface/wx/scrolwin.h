/**

    The wxScrolled class manages scrolling for its client area, transforming
    the coordinates according to the scrollbar positions, and setting the
    scroll positions, thumb sizes and ranges according to the area in view.

    There are two commonly used (but not the only possible!) specializations of
    this class:

    - ::wxScrolledWindow, aka wxScrolled<wxPanel>, is equivalent to
      ::wxScrolledWindow from earlier versions. Derived from wxPanel, it shares
      wxPanel's behaviour with regard to TAB traversal and focus handling. Use
      this if the scrolled window will have child controls.

    - ::wxScrolledCanvas, aka wxScrolled<wxWindow>, derives from wxWindow and
      so doesn't handle children specially. This is suitable e.g. for
      implementing scrollable controls such as tree or list controls.

    Starting from version 2.4 of wxWidgets, there are several ways to use a
    ::wxScrolledWindow (and now wxScrolled). In particular, there are
    three ways to set the size of the scrolling area:

    One way is to set the scrollbars directly using a call to SetScrollbars().
    This is the way it used to be in any previous version of wxWidgets and it
    will be kept for backwards compatibility.

    An additional method of manual control, which requires a little less
    computation of your own, is to set the total size of the scrolling area by
    calling either wxWindow::SetVirtualSize(), or wxWindow::FitInside(), and
    setting the scrolling increments for it by calling SetScrollRate().
    Scrolling in some orientation is enabled by setting a non-zero increment
    for it.

    The most automatic and newest way is to simply let sizers determine the
    scrolling area. This is now the default when you set an interior sizer into
    a wxScrolled with wxWindow::SetSizer().  The scrolling area will be
    set to the size requested by the sizer and the scrollbars will be assigned
    for each orientation according to the need for them and the scrolling
    increment set by SetScrollRate().  As above, scrolling is only enabled in
    orientations with a non-zero increment.  You can influence the minimum size
    of the scrolled area controlled by a sizer by calling
    wxWindow::SetVirtualSizeHints(). (Calling SetScrollbars() has analogous
    effects in wxWidgets 2.4 -- in later versions it may not continue to
    override the sizer.)

    Note that if maximum size hints are still supported by
    wxWindow::SetVirtualSizeHints(), use them at your own dire risk. They may
    or may not have been removed for 2.4, but it really only makes sense to set
    minimum size hints here.  We should probably replace
    wxWindow::SetVirtualSizeHints() with wxWindow::SetMinVirtualSize() or
    similar and remove it entirely in future.

    @todo review docs for this class replacing SetVirtualSizeHints() with
          SetMinClientSize().

    As with all windows, an application can draw onto a wxScrolled using a
    @ref overview_dc "device context".

    You have the option of handling the OnPaint handler or overriding the
    wxScrolled::OnDraw() function, which is passed a pre-scrolled device
    context (prepared by wxScrolled::DoPrepareDC()).

    If you don't wish to calculate your own scrolling, you must call
    DoPrepareDC() when not drawing from within OnDraw(), to set the device
    origin for the device context according to the current scroll position.

    A wxScrolled will normally scroll itself and therefore its child windows
    as well. It might however be desired to scroll a different window than
    itself: e.g. when designing a spreadsheet, you will normally only have to
    scroll the (usually white) cell area, whereas the (usually grey) label area
    will scroll very differently. For this special purpose, you can call
    SetTargetWindow() which means that pressing the scrollbars will scroll a
    different window.

    Note that the underlying system knows nothing about scrolling coordinates,
    so that all system functions (mouse events, expose events, refresh calls
    etc) as well as the position of subwindows are relative to the "physical"
    origin of the scrolled window. If the user insert a child window at
    position (10,10) and scrolls the window down 100 pixels (moving the child
    window out of the visible area), the child window will report a position
    of (10,-90).

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxHSCROLL}
           If this style is specified and ::wxVSCROLL isn't, the window will be
           scrollable only in horizontal direction (by default, i.e. if neither
           this style nor ::wxVSCROLL is specified, it scrolls in both
           directions).
    @style{wxVSCROLL}
           If this style is specified and ::wxHSCROLL isn't, the window will be
           scrollable only in vertical direction (by default, i.e. if neither
           this style nor ::wxHSCROLL is specified, it scrolls in both
           directions).
    @style{wxALWAYS_SHOW_SB}
           Since wxWidgets 2.9.5, specifying this style makes the window always
           show its scrollbars, even if they are not used. See ShowScrollbars().
    @style{wxRETAINED}
           Uses a backing pixmap to speed refreshes. Motif only.

    @event{EVT_SCROLLWIN_TOP(func)}

        Process @c wxEVT_SCROLLWIN_THUMBRELEASE thumb release events.
    @endEventTable

    @note
        Don't confuse wxScrollWinEvents generated by this class with
        wxScrollEvent objects generated by wxScrollBar and wxSlider.


    @remarks
    Use wxScrolled for applications where the user scrolls by a fixed amount,
    and where a 'page' can be interpreted to be the current visible portion of
    the window. For more sophisticated applications, use the wxScrolled
    implementation as a guide to build your own scroll behaviour or use
    wxVScrolledWindow or its variants.

    @since The wxScrolled template exists since version 2.9.0. In older versions,
           only ::wxScrolledWindow (equivalent of wxScrolled<wxPanel>) was
           available.

        DoPrepareDC() is called automatically within the default @c wxEVT_PAINT
        event handler, so your OnDraw() override will be passed an already
        'pre-scrolled' device context. However, if you wish to draw from
        outside of OnDraw() (e.g. from your own @c wxEVT_PAINT handler), you
        must call this function yourself.

        For example:
        @code
        void MyWindow::OnEvent(wxMouseEvent& event)
        {
          wxClientDC dc(this);
          DoPrepareDC(dc);

        Notice that the function sets the origin by moving it relatively to the
        current origin position, so you shouldn't change the origin before
        calling DoPrepareDC() or, if you do, reset it to (0, 0) later. If you
        call DoPrepareDC() immediately after device context creation, as in the
        example above, this problem doesn't arise, of course, so it is

/**
    Scrolled window derived from wxPanel.

    See wxScrolled for a detailed description.

    @note Note that because this class derives from wxPanel, it shares its
          behaviour with regard to TAB traversal and focus handling (in
          particular, it forwards focus to its children). If you don't want
          this behaviour, use ::wxScrolledCanvas instead.

    @note ::wxScrolledWindow is an alias for wxScrolled<wxPanel> since version
          2.9.0. In older versions, it was a standalone class.
