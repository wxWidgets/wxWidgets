    @class wxVarScrollHelperBase

    This class provides all common base functionality for scroll calculations
    shared among all variable scrolled window implementations as well as
    automatic scrollbar functionality, saved scroll positions, controlling
    target windows to be scrolled, as well as defining all required virtual
    functions that need to be implemented for any orientation specific work.

    Documentation of this class is provided specifically for referencing use
    of the functions provided by this class for use with the variable scrolled
    windows that derive from here. You will likely want to derive your window
    from one of the already implemented variable scrolled windows rather than
    from wxVarScrollHelperBase directly.

/**
    @class wxVScrolledWindow

    In the name of this class, "V" may stand for "variable" because it can be
    used for scrolling rows of variable heights; "virtual", because it is not
    necessary to know the heights of all rows in advance -- only those which
    are shown on the screen need to be measured; or even "vertical", because
    this class only supports scrolling vertically.

    In any case, this is a generalization of wxScrolled which can be only used
    when all rows have the same heights. It lacks some other wxScrolled
    features however, notably it can't scroll specific pixel sizes of the
    window or its exact client area size.

    To use this class, you need to derive from it and implement the
    OnGetRowHeight() pure virtual method. You also must call SetRowCount() to
    let the base class know how many rows it should display, but from that
    moment on the scrolling is handled entirely by wxVScrolledWindow. You only
    need to draw the visible part of contents in your @c OnPaint() method as
    usual. You should use GetVisibleRowsBegin() and GetVisibleRowsEnd() to
    select the lines to display. Note that the device context origin is not
    shifted so the first visible row always appears at the point (0, 0) in
    physical as well as logical coordinates.

    @section vscrolledwindow_compat wxWidgets 2.8 Compatibility Functions

    The following functions provide backwards compatibility for applications
    originally built using wxVScrolledWindow in 2.6 or 2.8. Originally,
    wxVScrolledWindow referred to scrolling "lines". We now use "units" in
    wxVarScrollHelperBase to avoid implying any orientation (since the
    functions are used for both horizontal and vertical scrolling in derived
    classes). And in the new wxVScrolledWindow and wxHScrolledWindow classes,
    we refer to them as "rows" and "columns", respectively. This is to help
    clear some confusion in not only those classes, but also in
    wxHVScrolledWindow where functions are inherited from both.

    You are encouraged to update any existing code using these function to use
    the new replacements mentioned below, and avoid using these functions for
    any new code as they are deprecated.

    @beginTable
    @row2col{ <tt>size_t %GetFirstVisibleLine() const</tt>,
        Deprecated for GetVisibleRowsBegin(). }
    @row2col{ <tt>size_t %GetLastVisibleLine() const</tt>,
        Deprecated for GetVisibleRowsEnd(). This function originally had a
        slight design flaw in that it was possible to return
        <tt>(size_t)-1</tt> (ie: a large positive number) if the scroll

/**
    @class wxHScrolledWindow

    In the name of this class, "H" stands for "horizontal" because it can be
    used for scrolling columns of variable widths. It is not necessary to know
    the widths of all columns in advance -- only those which are shown on the
    screen need to be measured.

    In any case, this is a generalization of wxScrolled which can be only used
    when all columns have the same widths. It lacks some other wxScrolled
    features however, notably it can't scroll specific pixel sizes of the
    window or its exact client area size.

    To use this class, you need to derive from it and implement the
    OnGetColumnWidth() pure virtual method. You also must call SetColumnCount()
    to let the base class know how many columns it should display, but from
    that moment on the scrolling is handled entirely by wxHScrolledWindow. You
    only need to draw the visible part of contents in your @c OnPaint() method
    as usual. You should use GetVisibleColumnsBegin() and
    GetVisibleColumnsEnd() to select the lines to display. Note that the device
    context origin is not shifted so the first visible column always appears at
    the point (0, 0) in physical as well as logical coordinates.
