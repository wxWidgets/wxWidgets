/**
    @class wxImage

    This class encapsulates a platform-independent image.

    An image can be created from data, or using wxBitmap::ConvertToImage.
    An image can be loaded from a file in a variety of formats, and is extensible
    to new formats via image format handlers. Functions are available to set and
    get image bits, so it can be used for basic image manipulation.

    A wxImage cannot (currently) be drawn directly to a wxDC.
    Instead, a platform-specific wxBitmap object must be created from it using
    the wxBitmap::wxBitmap(wxImage,int depth) constructor.
    This bitmap can then be drawn in a device context, using wxDC::DrawBitmap.

    More on the difference between wxImage and wxBitmap: wxImage is just a
    buffer of RGB bytes with an optional buffer for the alpha bytes. It is all
    generic, platform independent and image file format independent code. It
    includes generic code for scaling, resizing, clipping, and other manipulations
    of the image data. OTOH, wxBitmap is intended to be a wrapper of whatever is
    the native image format that is quickest/easiest to draw to a DC or to be the
    target of the drawing operations performed on a wxMemoryDC. By splitting the
    responsibilities between wxImage/wxBitmap like this then it's easier to use
    generic code shared by all platforms and image types for generic operations and
    platform specific code where performance or compatibility is needed.

    One colour value of the image may be used as a mask colour which will lead to
    the automatic creation of a wxMask object associated to the bitmap object.


    @section image_alpha Alpha channel support

    Starting from wxWidgets 2.5.0 wxImage supports alpha channel data, that is
    in addition to a byte for the red, green and blue colour components for each
    pixel it also stores a byte representing the pixel opacity.

    An alpha value of 0 corresponds to a transparent pixel (null opacity) while
    a value of 255 means that the pixel is 100% opaque.
    The constants ::wxIMAGE_ALPHA_TRANSPARENT and ::wxIMAGE_ALPHA_OPAQUE can be
    used to indicate those values in a more readable form.

    While all images have RGB data, not all images have an alpha channel. Before
    using wxImage::GetAlpha you should check if this image contains an alpha
    channel with wxImage::HasAlpha. Currently the BMP, PNG, TGA, and TIFF format
    handlers have full alpha channel support for loading so if you want to use
    alpha you have to use one of these formats. If you initialize the image
    alpha channel yourself using wxImage::SetAlpha, you should save it in
    either PNG, TGA, or TIFF format to avoid losing it as these are the only
    handlers that currently support saving with alpha.


    @section image_handlers Available image handlers

    The following image handlers are available.
    wxBMPHandler is always installed by default.
    To use other image formats, install the appropriate handler with
    wxImage::AddHandler or call ::wxInitAllImageHandlers().

    - wxBMPHandler: For loading (including alpha support) and saving, always installed.
    - wxPNGHandler: For loading and saving. Includes alpha support.
    - wxJPEGHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxGIFHandler: For loading and saving (see below).
    - wxPCXHandler: For loading and saving (see below).
    - wxPNMHandler: For loading and saving (see below).
    - wxTIFFHandler: For loading and saving. Includes alpha support.
    - wxTGAHandler: For loading and saving. Includes alpha support.
    - wxIFFHandler: For loading only.
    - wxXPMHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxICOHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxCURHandler: For loading and saving.
    - wxANIHandler: For loading only.

    When saving in PCX format, wxPCXHandler will count the number of different
    colours in the image; if there are 256 or less colours, it will save as 8 bit,
    else it will save as 24 bit.

    Loading PNMs only works for ASCII or raw RGB images.
    When saving in PNM format, wxPNMHandler will always save as raw RGB.

    Saving GIFs requires images of maximum 8 bpp (see wxQuantize), and the alpha channel converted to a mask (see wxImage::ConvertAlphaToMask).
    Saving an animated GIF requires images of the same size (see wxGIFHandler::SaveAnimation)

        This is also useful for scaling bitmaps in general as the only other way

        The parameter @a quality determines what method to use for resampling
        the image, see wxImageResizeQuality documentation.

        It should be noted that although using @c wxIMAGE_QUALITY_HIGH produces much nicer
        looking results it is a slower method. Downsampling will use the box averaging
        method which seems to operate very fast. If you are upsampling larger images using
        this method you will most likely notice that it is a bit slower and in extreme
        cases it will be quite substantially slower as the bicubic algorithm has to process a
        lot of data.

        It should also be noted that the high quality scaling may not work as expected
        when using a single mask colour for transparency, as the scaling will blur the
        image and will therefore remove the mask partially. Using the alpha channel
        will work.

        Example:
        @code
        // get the bitmap from somewhere
        wxBitmap bmp = ...;

        // rescale it to have size of 32*32

            one right now) support rescaling the image during loading which is
            vastly more efficient than loading the entire huge image and
            rescaling it later (if these options are not supported by the
            handler, this is still what happens however). These options must be
            set before calling LoadFile() to have any effect.

        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_ORIGINAL_WIDTH and @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_ORIGINAL_HEIGHT:
            These options will return the original size of the image if either
            @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_MAX_WIDTH or @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_MAX_HEIGHT is
            specified.
            @since 2.9.3

        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_QUALITY: JPEG quality used when saving. This is an
            integer in 0..100 range with 0 meaning very poor and 100 excellent
            (but very badly compressed). This option is currently ignored for
            the other formats.

        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONUNIT: The value of this option determines
            whether the resolution of the image is specified in centimetres or
            inches, see wxImageResolution enum elements.

        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTION, @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONX and
            @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONY: These options define the resolution of
            the image in the units corresponding to @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_RESOLUTIONUNIT
            options value. The first option can be set before saving the image
            to set both horizontal and vertical resolution to the same value.
            The X and Y options are set by the image handlers if they support
            the image resolution (currently BMP, JPEG and TIFF handlers do) and
            the image provides the resolution information and can be queried
            after loading the image.

        Options specific to wxPNGHandler:
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_FORMAT: Format for saving a PNG file, see
            wxImagePNGType for the supported values.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_BITDEPTH: Bit depth for every channel (R/G/B/A).
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_FILTER: Filter for saving a PNG file, see libpng
            (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-1.2.5-manual.html) for possible values
            (e.g. PNG_FILTER_NONE, PNG_FILTER_SUB, PNG_FILTER_UP, etc).
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_LEVEL: Compression level (0..9) for
            saving a PNG file. An high value creates smaller-but-slower PNG file.
            Note that unlike other formats (e.g. JPEG) the PNG format is always
            lossless and thus this compression level doesn't tradeoff the image
            quality.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_MEM_LEVEL: Compression memory usage
            level (1..9) for saving a PNG file. An high value means the saving
            process consumes more memory, but may create smaller PNG file.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_STRATEGY: Possible values are 0 for
            default strategy, 1 for filter, and 2 for Huffman-only.
            You can use OptiPNG (http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) to get a suitable
            value for your application.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_PNG_COMPRESSION_BUFFER_SIZE: Internal buffer size
            (in bytes) for saving a PNG file. Ideally this should be as big as
            the resulting PNG file. Use this option if your application produces
            images with small size variation.

        Options specific to wxTIFFHandler:
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_BITSPERSAMPLE: Number of bits per
            sample (channel). Currently values of 1 and 8 are supported. A
            value of 1 results in a black and white image. A value of 8 (the
            default) can mean greyscale or RGB, depending on the value of
            @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_SAMPLESPERPIXEL.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_SAMPLESPERPIXEL: Number of samples
            (channels) per pixel. Currently values of 1 and 3 are supported.
            A value of 1 results in either a greyscale (by default) or black and
            white image, depending on the value of
            @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_BITSPERSAMPLE. A value of 3 (the default)
            will result in an RGB image.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_COMPRESSION: Compression type. By default
            it is set to 1 (COMPRESSION_NONE). Typical other values are
            5 (COMPRESSION_LZW) and 7 (COMPRESSION_JPEG). See tiff.h for more
            options.
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_PHOTOMETRIC: Specifies the photometric
            interpretation. By default it is set to 2 (PHOTOMETRIC_RGB) for RGB
            images and 0 (PHOTOMETRIC_MINISWHITE) for greyscale or black and
            white images. It can also be set to 1 (PHOTOMETRIC_MINISBLACK) to
            treat the lowest value as black and highest as white.
            If you want a greyscale image it is also sufficient to only specify
            @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_PHOTOMETRIC and set it to either
            PHOTOMETRIC_MINISWHITE or PHOTOMETRIC_MINISBLACK. The other values
            are taken care of.

        Options specific to wxGIFHandler:
        @li @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_GIF_TRANSPARENCY: How to deal with transparent pixels.
            By default, the color of transparent pixels is changed to bright pink, so
            that if the image is accidentally drawn without transparency, it will be
            obvious.
            Normally, this would not be noticed, as these pixels will not be rendered.
            But in some cases it might be useful to load a GIF without making any
            modifications to its colours.
            Use @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_GIF_TRANSPARENCY_UNCHANGED to keep the colors correct.
            Use @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_GIF_TRANSPARENCY_HIGHLIGHT to convert transparent pixels
            to pink (default).
            This option has been added in wxWidgets 3.1.1.

        @note
        Be careful when combining the options @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_SAMPLESPERPIXEL,
        @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_BITSPERSAMPLE, and @c wxIMAGE_OPTION_TIFF_PHOTOMETRIC.
        While some measures are taken to prevent illegal combinations and/or

        pixels in the image who corresponding pixel in mask has given RGB value.

        The parameters @a mr, @a mg, @a mb are the RGB values of the pixels in
        mask that will be used to create the mask.

        @return Returns @false if mask does not have same dimensions as the image
                or if there is no unused colour left. Returns @true if the mask
                was successfully applied.
