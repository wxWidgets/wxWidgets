/**
    An info bar is a transient window shown at top or bottom of its parent
    window to display non-critical information to the user.

    This class provides another way to show messages to the user, intermediate
    between message boxes and status bar messages. The message boxes are modal
    and thus interrupt the users work flow and should be used sparingly for
    this reason. However status bar messages are often too easy not to notice
    at all. An info bar provides a way to present the messages which has a much
    higher chance to be noticed by the user but without being annoying.

    Info bar may show an icon (on the left), text message and, optionally,
    buttons allowing the user to react to the information presented. It always
    has a close button at the right allowing the user to dismiss it so it isn't
    necessary to provide a button just to close it.

    wxInfoBar calls its parent wxWindow::Layout() method and assumes that it
    will change the parent layout appropriately depending on whether the info
    bar itself is shown or hidden. Usually this is achieved by simply using a
    sizer for the parent window layout and adding wxInfoBar to this sizer as
    one of the items. Considering the usual placement of the info bars,
    normally this sizer should be a vertical wxBoxSizer and the bar its first
    or last element so the simplest possible example of using this class would
    be:
    @code
    class MyFrame : public wxFrame
    {
        ...

        wxInfoBar *m_infoBar;
    };

    MyFrame::MyFrame()
    {
        ...
        m_infoBar = new wxInfoBar(this);

        wxSizer *sizer = new wxBoxSizer(wxVERTICAL);
        sizer->Add(m_infoBar, wxSizerFlags().Expand());
        ... add other frame controls to the sizer ...
        SetSizer(sizer);
    }

    void MyFrame::SomeMethod()
    {
        m_infoBar->ShowMessage("Something happend", wxICON_INFORMATION);
    }
    @endcode

    See the dialogs sample for more sophisticated examples.


    Currently this class is implemented generically (i.e. in the same
    platform-independent way for all ports) and also natively in wxGTK but the
    native implementation requires a recent -- as of this writing -- GTK+ 2.18
    version.

    /**
        Create the info bar window.

        Notice that unlike most of the other wxWindow-derived classes,
        wxInfoBar is created hidden and is only shown when ShowMessage() is
        called. This is more convenient as usually the info bar is created to
        be shown at some later time and not immediately and so creating it
        hidden avoids the need to call Hide() explicitly from the code using
        it.

        This should be only called if the object was created using its default
        constructor.

        @param parent
            A valid parent window pointer.
        @param winid
            The id of the info bar window, usually unused as currently no
            events are generated by this class.

        Add a button to be shown in the info bar.

        The button added by this method will be shown to the right of the text
        (in LTR layout), with each successive button being added to the right
        of the previous one.

        Clicking the button will generate a normal event which can be handled
        as usual. Notice that if you wish the info bar to be hidden when the
        button is clicked, simply call @c event.Skip() in the button handler to
        let the base class handler do it.

        @param btnid
            Id of the button. It will be used in the button message clicking
            this button will generate.
        @param label
            The label of the button. It may only be empty if @a btnid is one of
            the stock ids in which case the corresponding stock label (see
            wxGetStockLabel()) will be used.

            The text of the message.

            One of wxICON_NONE, wxICON_INFORMATION (default), wxICON_QUESTION,
            wxICON_WARNING or wxICON_ERROR values. These flags have the same
            meaning as in wxMessageDialog for the generic version, i.e. show
            (or not, in case of wxICON_NONE) the corresponding icon in the bar
            but can be interpreted by the native versions. For example, the
            GTK+ native implementation doesn't show icons at all but uses this
            parameter to select the appropriate background colour for the
            notification.

        All these methods exist in the generic version of the class only.

        The generic version uses wxWindow::ShowWithEffect() function to
        progressively show it on the platforms which support it (currently only
        wxMSW). The methods here allow to change the default effect used (or
