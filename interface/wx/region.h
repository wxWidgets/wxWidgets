    @class wxRegion

    A wxRegion represents a simple or complex region on a device context or window.

    This class uses @ref overview_refcount "reference counting and copy-on-write"
    internally so that assignments between two instances of this class are very
    cheap. You can therefore use actual objects instead of pointers without
    efficiency problems. If an instance of this class is changed it will create
    its own data internally so that other instances, which previously shared the
    data using the reference counting, are not affected.
