    @class wxStopWatch

    The wxStopWatch class allow you to measure time intervals.

    For example, you may use it to measure the time elapsed by some function:

    @code
        wxStopWatch sw;
        CallLongRunningFunction();
        wxLogMessage("The long running function took %ldms to execute",
                     sw.Time());
        sw.Pause();
        ... stopwatch is stopped now ...
        sw.Resume();
        CallLongRunningFunction();
        wxLogMessage("And calling it twice took $ldms in all", sw.Time());
    @endcode

    Since wxWidgets 2.9.3 this class uses @c QueryPerformanceCounter()
    function under MSW to measure the elapsed time. It provides higher
    precision than the usual timer functions but can suffer from bugs in its
    implementation in some Windows XP versions. If you encounter such problems,
    installing a Microsoft hot fix from http://support.microsoft.com/?id=896256
    could be necessary.

        If this method is called several times, @c Resume() must be called the same

        This method is similar to Time() but returns the elapsed time in
        microseconds and not milliseconds. Notice that not all platforms really
        can measure times with this precision.
