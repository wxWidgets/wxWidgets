    @class wxDataViewModel

    wxDataViewModel is the base class for all data model to be displayed by a
    wxDataViewCtrl.

    All other models derive from it and must implement its pure virtual functions
    in order to define a complete data model. In detail, you need to override
    wxDataViewModel::IsContainer, wxDataViewModel::GetParent, wxDataViewModel::GetChildren,
    wxDataViewModel::GetColumnCount, wxDataViewModel::GetColumnType and
    wxDataViewModel::GetValue in order to define the data model which acts as an
    interface between your actual data and the wxDataViewCtrl.

    Note that wxDataViewModel does not define the position or index of any item
    in the control because different controls might display the same data differently.
    wxDataViewModel does provide a wxDataViewModel::Compare method which the
    wxDataViewCtrl may use to sort the data either in conjunction with a column
    header or without (see wxDataViewModel::HasDefaultCompare).

    wxDataViewModel (as indeed the entire wxDataViewCtrl code) is using wxVariant
    to store data and its type in a generic way. wxVariant can be extended to contain
    almost any data without changes to the original class. To a certain extent,
    you can use (the somewhat more elegant) wxAny instead of wxVariant as there
    is code to convert between the two, but it is unclear what impact this will
    have on performance.

    Since you will usually allow the wxDataViewCtrl to change your data
    through its graphical interface, you will also have to override
    wxDataViewModel::SetValue which the wxDataViewCtrl will call when a change
    to some data has been committed.

    If the data represented by the model is changed by something else than its
    associated wxDataViewCtrl, the control has to be notified about the change.
    Depending on what happened you need to call one of the following methods:
    - wxDataViewModel::ValueChanged,
    - wxDataViewModel::ItemAdded,
    - wxDataViewModel::ItemDeleted,
    - wxDataViewModel::ItemChanged,
    - wxDataViewModel::Cleared.

    There are plural forms for notification of addition, change or removal of
    several item at once. See:
    - wxDataViewModel::ItemsAdded,
    - wxDataViewModel::ItemsDeleted,
    - wxDataViewModel::ItemsChanged.

    This class maintains a list of wxDataViewModelNotifier which link this class
    to the specific implementations on the supported platforms so that e.g. calling
    wxDataViewModel::ValueChanged on this model will just call
    wxDataViewModelNotifier::ValueChanged for each notifier that has been added.
    You can also add your own notifier in order to get informed about any changes
    to the data in the list model.

    Currently wxWidgets provides the following models apart from the base model:
    wxDataViewIndexListModel, wxDataViewVirtualListModel, wxDataViewTreeStore,
    wxDataViewListStore.

    Note that wxDataViewModel is reference counted, derives from wxRefCounter
    and cannot be deleted directly as it can be shared by several wxDataViewCtrls.
    This implies that you need to decrease the reference count after
    associating the model with a control like this:

    @code
        wxDataViewCtrl *musicCtrl = new wxDataViewCtrl( this, wxID_ANY );
        wxDataViewModel *musicModel = new MyMusicModel;
        m_musicCtrl->AssociateModel( musicModel );
        musicModel->DecRef();  // avoid memory leak !!

        // add columns now
    @endcode

    A potentially better way to avoid memory leaks is to use wxObjectDataPtr
    
    @code
        wxObjectDataPtr<MyMusicModel> musicModel;
        
        wxDataViewCtrl *musicCtrl = new wxDataViewCtrl( this, wxID_ANY );
        musicModel = new MyMusicModel;
        m_musicCtrl->AssociateModel( musicModel.get() );

        // add columns now
    @endcode

    If you only need to display a simple tree structure with an API more like the

    wxDataViewListCtrl can be used without defining  your own wxDataViewModel.

    A wxDataViewItem is used to represent a (visible) item in the control.

    Unlike wxListCtrl, wxDataViewCtrl doesn't get its data from the user through
    virtual functions or by setting it directly. Instead you need to write your own
    wxDataViewModel and associate it with this control.
    Then you need to add a number of wxDataViewColumn to this control to define
    what each column shall display. Each wxDataViewColumn in turn owns 1 instance
    of a wxDataViewRenderer to render its cells.

    A number of standard renderers for rendering text, dates, images, toggle,
    a progress bar etc. are provided. Additionally, the user can write custom
    renderers deriving from wxDataViewCustomRenderer for displaying anything.

    All data transfer from the control to the model and the user code is done
    through wxVariant which can be extended to support more data formats as necessary.
    Accordingly, all type information uses the strings returned from wxVariant::GetType.

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxDV_SINGLE}
           Single selection mode. This is the default.
    @style{wxDV_MULTIPLE}
           Multiple selection mode.
    @style{wxDV_ROW_LINES}
           Use alternating colours for rows if supported by platform and theme.
           Currently only supported by the native GTK and OS X implementations
           but not by the generic one.
    @style{wxDV_HORIZ_RULES}
           Display fine rules between row if supported.
    @style{wxDV_VERT_RULES}
           Display fine rules between columns is supported.
    @style{wxDV_VARIABLE_LINE_HEIGHT}
           Allow variable line heights.
           This can be inefficient when displaying large number of items.
    @style{wxDV_NO_HEADER}
           Do not show column headers (which are shown by default).
