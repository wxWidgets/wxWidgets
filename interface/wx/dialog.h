    @class wxDialog

    A dialog box is a window with a title bar and sometimes a system menu,
    which can be moved around the screen. It can contain controls and other
    windows and is often used to allow the user to make some choice or to
    answer a question.

    Dialogs can be made scrollable, automatically, for computers with low
    resolution screens: please see @ref overview_dialog_autoscrolling for
    further details.

    Dialogs usually contains either a single button allowing to close the
    dialog or two buttons, one accepting the changes and the other one
    discarding them (such button, if present, is automatically activated if the
    user presses the "Esc" key). By default, buttons with the standard wxID_OK
    and wxID_CANCEL identifiers behave as expected. Starting with wxWidgets 2.7
    it is also possible to use a button with a different identifier instead,
    see SetAffirmativeId() and SetEscapeId().

    Also notice that the CreateButtonSizer() should be used to create the
    buttons appropriate for the current platform and positioned correctly
    (including their order which is platform-dependent).

    @section dialog_modal Modal and Modeless

    There are two kinds of dialog, modal and modeless. A modal dialog blocks
    program flow and user input on other windows until it is dismissed, whereas
    a modeless dialog behaves more like a frame in that program flow continues,
    and input in other windows is still possible. To show a modal dialog you
    should use the ShowModal() method while to show a dialog modelessly you
    simply use Show(), just as with frames.

    Note that the modal dialog is one of the very few examples of
    wxWindow-derived objects which may be created on the stack and not on the
    heap. In other words, while most windows would be created like this:

    @code
    void AskUser()
    {
        MyAskDialog *dlg = new MyAskDialog(...);
        if ( dlg->ShowModal() == wxID_OK )
            // ...
        //else: dialog was cancelled or some another button pressed

        dlg->Destroy();
    }
    @endcode

    You can achieve the same result with dialogs by using simpler code:

    @code
    void AskUser()
    {
        MyAskDialog dlg(...);
        if ( dlg.ShowModal() == wxID_OK )
            // ...

        // no need to call Destroy() here
    }
    @endcode

    An application can define a wxCloseEvent handler for the dialog to respond
    to system close events.

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxCAPTION}
           Puts a caption on the dialog box.
    @style{wxDEFAULT_DIALOG_STYLE}
           Equivalent to a combination of wxCAPTION, wxCLOSE_BOX and
           wxSYSTEM_MENU (the last one is not used under Unix).
    @style{wxRESIZE_BORDER}
           Display a resizable frame around the window.
    @style{wxSYSTEM_MENU}
           Display a system menu.
    @style{wxCLOSE_BOX}
           Displays a close box on the frame.
    @style{wxMAXIMIZE_BOX}
           Displays a maximize box on the dialog.
    @style{wxMINIMIZE_BOX}
           Displays a minimize box on the dialog.
    @style{wxTHICK_FRAME}
           Display a thick frame around the window.
    @style{wxSTAY_ON_TOP}
           The dialog stays on top of all other windows.
    @style{wxNO_3D}
           Under Windows, specifies that the child controls should not have 3D
           borders unless specified in the control.
    @style{wxDIALOG_NO_PARENT}
           By default, a dialog created with a @NULL parent window will be
           given the @ref wxApp::GetTopWindow() "application's top level window"
           as parent. Use this style to prevent this from happening and create
           an orphan dialog. This is not recommended for modal dialogs.
    @style{wxDIALOG_EX_CONTEXTHELP}
           Under Windows, puts a query button on the caption. When pressed,
           Windows will go into a context-sensitive help mode and wxWidgets
           will send a @c wxEVT_HELP event if the user clicked on an application
           window. Note that this is an extended style and must be set by
           calling SetExtraStyle() before Create is called (two-step
           construction).
    @style{wxDIALOG_EX_METAL}
           On Mac OS X, frames with this style will be shown with a metallic
           look. This is an extra style.
    @endStyleTable

    Under Unix or Linux, MWM (the Motif Window Manager) or other window
    managers recognizing the MHM hints should be running for any of these
    styles to have an effect.


    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxCloseEvent}
    @event{EVT_CLOSE(func)}
        The dialog is being closed by the user or programmatically (see wxWindow::Close).
        The user may generate this event clicking the close button
        (typically the 'X' on the top-right of the title bar) if it's present
        (see the @c wxCLOSE_BOX style) or by clicking a button with the
        @c wxID_CANCEL or @c wxID_OK ids.
    @event{EVT_INIT_DIALOG(func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_INIT_DIALOG event. See wxInitDialogEvent.

        Shows a dialog modal to the parent top level window only.

        Unlike ShowModal(), dialogs shown with this function only prevent the
        user from interacting with their parent frame only but not with the
        rest of the application. They also don't block the program execution
        but instead return immediately, as Show(), and generate a
        wxEVT_WINDOW_MODAL_DIALOG_CLOSED event later when the dialog is closed.

        Currently this function is only fully implemented in wxOSX ports, under
        the other platforms it behaves like ShowModal() (but also sends the
        above mentioned event).

/**
    @class wxDialogLayoutAdapter

    This abstract class is the base for classes that help wxWidgets perform
    run-time layout adaptation of dialogs. Principally, this is to cater for
    small displays by making part of the dialog scroll, but the application
    developer may find other uses for layout adaption.

    By default, there is one instance of wxStandardDialogLayoutAdapter which
    can perform adaptation for most custom dialogs and dialogs with book
    controls such as wxPropertySheetDialog.
