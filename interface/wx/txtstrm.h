/**
    @class wxTextInputStream

    This class provides functions that reads text data using an input stream,
    allowing you to read text, floats, and integers.

    The wxTextInputStream correctly reads text files (or streams) in DOS,
    Macintosh and Unix formats and reports a single newline char as a line
    ending.

    wxTextInputStream::operator>>() is overloaded and you can use this class
    like a standard C++ iostream. Note, however, that the arguments are the
    fixed size types wxUint32, wxInt32 etc and on a typical 32-bit computer,
    none of these match to the "long" type (wxInt32 is defined as int on 32-bit
    architectures) so that you cannot use long. To avoid problems (here and
    elsewhere), make use of wxInt32, wxUint32 and similar types.

    If you're scanning through a file using wxTextInputStream, you should check
    for @c EOF @b before reading the next item (word / number), because
    otherwise the last item may get lost. You should however be prepared to
    receive an empty item (empty string / zero number) at the end of file,
    especially on Windows systems. This is unavoidable because most (but not
    all) files end with whitespace (i.e. usually a newline).

    For example:

    @code
    wxFileInputStream input( "mytext.txt" );
    wxTextInputStream text( input );
    wxUint8 i1;
    float f2;
    wxString line;

    text >> i1;       // read a 8 bit integer.
    text >> i1 >> f2; // read a 8 bit integer followed by float.
    text >> line;     // read a text line
    @endcode
