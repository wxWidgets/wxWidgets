    wxDynamicLibrary is a class representing dynamically loadable library
    (Windows DLL, shared library under Unix etc). Just create an object of
    this class to load a library and don't worry about unloading it -- it will
    be done in the objects destructor automatically.

    The following flags can be used with wxDynamicLibrary() or Load():

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxDL_LAZY}
           Equivalent of RTLD_LAZY under Unix, ignored elsewhere.
    @style{wxDL_NOW}
           Equivalent of RTLD_NOW under Unix, ignored elsewhere.
    @style{wxDL_GLOBAL}
           Equivalent of RTLD_GLOBAL under Unix, ignored elsewhere.
    @style{wxDL_VERBATIM}
           Don't try to append the appropriate extension to the library name
           (this is done by default).
    @style{wxDL_DEFAULT}
           Default flags, same as wxDL_NOW currently.
    @style{wxDL_QUIET}
           Don't log an error message if the library couldn't be loaded.
