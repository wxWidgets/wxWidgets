    @class wxControl

    This is the base class for a control or "widget".

    A control is generally a small window which processes user input and/or
    displays one or more item of data.

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxClipboardTextEvent}
    @event{EVT_TEXT_COPY(id, func)}
           Some or all of the controls content was copied to the clipboard.
    @event{EVT_TEXT_CUT(id, func)}
           Some or all of the controls content was cut (i.e. copied and
           deleted).
    @event{EVT_TEXT_PASTE(id, func)}
           Clipboard content was pasted into the control.

            Pointer to a parent window.
        @param id
            Control identifier. If wxID_ANY, will automatically create an identifier.
        @param pos
            Control position. wxDefaultPosition indicates that wxWidgets
            should generate a default position for the control.

            Control size. wxDefaultSize indicates that wxWidgets should generate
            a default size for the window. If no suitable size can  be found, the

        This function is mostly useful with control displaying short amounts of
        text that can be edited by the user, e.g. wxTextCtrl, wxComboBox,
        wxSearchCtrl etc. Typically it is used to size these controls for the
        maximal amount of input they are supposed to contain, for example:
        @code
            // Create a control for post code entry.
            wxTextCtrl* postcode = new wxTextCtrl(this, ...);

            // And set its initial and minimal size to be big enough for
            // entering 5 digits.

        and wxChoice in wxMSW and wxGTK.

        @param xlen The horizontal extent of the area to leave for text, in

            pixels. By default -1 meaning that the vertical component of the
            returned size should be the default height of this control.
        @return The size that the control should have to leave the area of the
            specified size for its text. May return wxDefaultSize if this
            method is not implemented for this particular control under the

    /**
        Sets the controls label to a string using markup.

        Simple markup supported by this function can be used to apply different
        fonts or colours to different parts of the control label when supported.
        If markup is not supported by the control or platform, it is simply
        stripped and SetLabel() is used with the resulting string.

        For example,
        @code
            wxStaticText *text;
            ...
            text->SetLabelMarkup("<b>&amp;Bed</b> &amp;mp; "

                                 "available <big>HERE</big>");
        @endcode
        would show the string using bold, red and big for the corresponding
        words under wxGTK but will simply show the string "Bed &amp; breakfast
        available HERE" on the other platforms. In any case, the "B" of "Bed"
        will be underlined to indicate that it can be used as a mnemonic for
        this control.

        The non-escaped ampersand @c &amp; characters are interpreted as
        mnemonics as with wxControl::SetLabel.


        @param markup
            String containing markup for the label. It may contain markup tags
            described above and newline characters but currently only wxGTK and
            wxOSX support multiline labels with markup, the generic
            implementation (also used in wxMSW) only handles single line markup
            labels. Notice that the string must be well-formed (e.g. all tags
            must be correctly closed) and won't be shown at all otherwise.
        @return
            @true if the new label was set (even if markup in it was ignored)
            or @false if we failed to parse the markup. In this case the label
            remains unchanged.


        Currently wxButton supports markup in all major ports (wxMSW, wxGTK and
        wxOSX/Cocoa) while wxStaticText supports it in wxGTK and wxOSX and its
        generic version (which can be used under MSW if markup support is
        required). Extending support to more controls is planned in the future.
