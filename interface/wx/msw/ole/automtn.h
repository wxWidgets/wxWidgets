    @class wxAutomationObject

    The @b wxAutomationObject class represents an OLE automation object containing
    a single data member,
    an IDispatch pointer. It contains a number of functions that make it easy to
    perform
    automation operations, and set and get properties. The class makes heavy use of
    the wxVariant class.

    The usage of these classes is quite close to OLE automation usage in Visual
    Basic. The API is
    high-level, and the application can specify multiple properties in a single
    string. The following example
    gets the current Excel instance, and if it exists, makes the active cell bold.

    @code
    wxAutomationObject excelObject;
      if (excelObject.GetInstance("Excel.Application"))
          excelObject.PutProperty("ActiveCell.Font.Bold", @true);
    @endcode

    Note that this class obviously works under Windows only.
