/**
    @class wxTempFile

    wxTempFile provides a relatively safe way to replace the contents of the
    existing file. The name is explained by the fact that it may be also used as
    just a temporary file if you don't replace the old file contents.

    Usually, when a program replaces the contents of some file it first opens it for
    writing, thus losing all of the old data and then starts recreating it.
    This approach is not very safe because during the regeneration of the file bad
    things may happen: the program may find that there is an internal error preventing
    it from completing file generation, the user may interrupt it (especially if file
    generation takes long time) and, finally, any other external interrupts (power
    supply failure or a disk error) will leave you without either the original file
    or the new one.

    wxTempFile addresses this problem by creating a temporary file which is meant to
    replace the original file - but only after it is fully written. So, if the user
    interrupts the program during the file generation, the old file won't be lost.
    Also, if the program discovers itself that it doesn't want to replace the old
    file there is no problem - in fact, wxTempFile will @b not replace the old
    file by default, you should explicitly call wxTempFile::Commit() to do it.
    Calling wxTempFile::Discard() explicitly discards any modifications: it
    closes and deletes the temporary file and leaves the original file unchanged.
    If you call neither Commit() nor Discard(), the destructor will
    call Discard() automatically.

    To summarize: if you want to replace another file, create an instance of
    wxTempFile passing the name of the file to be replaced to the constructor.
    (You may also use default constructor and pass the file name to wxTempFile::Open.)
    Then you can write to wxTempFile using wxFile-like functions and later call
    wxTempFile::Commit() to replace the old file (and close this one) or call
    wxTempFile::Discard() to cancel the modifications.

/**
    @class wxFile

    A wxFile performs raw file I/O. This is a very small class designed to
    minimize the overhead of using it - in fact, there is hardly any overhead at
    all, but using it brings you automatic error checking and hides differences
    between platforms and compilers. wxFile also automatically closes the file in
    its destructor so you won't forget to do so.
    wxFile is a wrapper around @c file descriptor. - see also wxFFile for a
    wrapper around @c FILE structure.

    ::wxFileOffset is used by the wxFile functions which require offsets as
    parameter or return them. If the platform supports it, wxFileOffset is a
    typedef for a native 64 bit integer, otherwise a 32 bit integer is used for
    ::wxFileOffset.
