/**
    @class wxGenericProgressDialog

    This class represents a dialog that shows a short message and a
    progress bar. Optionally, it can display ABORT and SKIP buttons, and
    the elapsed, remaining and estimated time for the end of the progress.

    This class provides a generic implementation of the progress dialog.  If
    the platform has a native progress dialog available then it will be
    accessible using the @a wxProgressDialog class, otherwise it will
    essentially be the same as this class.

    Note that you must be aware that wxProgressDialog internally calls
    wxEventLoopBase::YieldFor with @c wxEVT_CATEGORY_UI and @c wxEVT_CATEGORY_USER_INPUT
    and this may cause unwanted re-entrancies or the out-of-order processing
    of pending events (to help preventing the last problem if you're using
    wxProgressDialog in a multi-threaded application you should be sure to use
    wxThreadEvent for your inter-threads communications).

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxPD_APP_MODAL}
           Make the progress dialog modal. If this flag is not given, it is
           only "locally" modal - that is the input to the parent window is
           disabled, but not to the other ones.
    @style{wxPD_AUTO_HIDE}
           Causes the progress dialog to disappear from screen as soon as the
           maximum value of the progress meter has been reached.
           If this style is not present, the dialog will become a modal dialog
           (see wxDialog::ShowModal) once the maximum value has been reached
           and wait for the user to dismiss it.
    @style{wxPD_SMOOTH}
           Causes smooth progress of the gauge control (uses a wxGauge with the
           @c wxGA_SMOOTH style).
    @style{wxPD_CAN_ABORT}
           This flag tells the dialog that it should have a "Cancel" button
           which the user may press. If this happens, the next call to
           Update() will return @false.
    @style{wxPD_CAN_SKIP}
           This flag tells the dialog that it should have a "Skip" button
           which the user may press. If this happens, the next call to
           Update() will return @true in its skip parameter.
    @style{wxPD_ELAPSED_TIME}
           This flag tells the dialog that it should show elapsed time (since
           creating the dialog).
    @style{wxPD_ESTIMATED_TIME}
           This flag tells the dialog that it should show estimated time.
    @style{wxPD_REMAINING_TIME}
           This flag tells the dialog that it should show remaining time.

        If @false is returned, the application can either immediately destroy the
        dialog or ask the user for the confirmation and if the abort is not confirmed
        the dialog may be resumed with Resume() function.

        If @a value is the maximum value for the dialog, the behaviour of the
        function depends on whether @c wxPD_AUTO_HIDE was used when the dialog
        was created. If it was, the dialog is hidden and the function returns
        immediately. If it was not, the dialog becomes a modal dialog and waits
        for the user to dismiss it, meaning that this function does not return
        until this happens.

        Notice that you may want to call Fit() to change the dialog size to
        conform to the length of the new message if desired. The dialog does
        not do this automatically.

        @param value
            The new value of the progress meter. It should be less than or equal to
            the maximum value given to the constructor.

            The new messages for the progress dialog text, if it is
            empty (which is the default) the message is not changed.
        @param skip
            If "Skip" button was pressed since last Update() call,
            this is set to @true.
