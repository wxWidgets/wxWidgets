    @class wxItemContainerImmutable

    wxItemContainer defines an interface which is implemented by all controls
    which have string subitems each of which may be selected.

    It is decomposed in wxItemContainerImmutable which omits all methods
    adding/removing items and is used by wxRadioBox and wxItemContainer itself.

    Note that this is not a control, it's a mixin interface that classes
    have to derive from in addition to wxControl or wxWindow.

    Examples: wxListBox, wxCheckListBox, wxChoice and wxComboBox (which
    implements an extended interface deriving from this one)

/**
    @class wxItemContainer

    This class is an abstract base class for some wxWidgets controls which
    contain several items such as wxListBox, wxCheckListBox, wxComboBox or
    wxChoice. It defines an interface which is implemented by all controls
    which have string subitems each of which may be selected.

    wxItemContainer extends wxItemContainerImmutable interface with methods
    for adding/removing items.

    It defines the methods for accessing the controls items and although each
    of the derived classes implements them differently, they still all conform
    to the same interface.

    The items in a wxItemContainer have (non-empty) string labels and,
    optionally, client data associated with them. Client data may be of two
    different kinds: either simple untyped (@c void *) pointers which are
    simply stored by the control but not used in any way by it, or typed
    pointers (wxClientData*) which are owned by the control meaning that the
    typed client data (and only it) will be deleted when an item is deleted
    using Delete() or the entire control is cleared using Clear(), which also
    happens when it is destroyed.

    Finally note that in the same control all items must have client data of
    the same type (typed or untyped), if any. This type is determined by the
    first call to Append() (the version with client data pointer) or
    SetClientData().

    Note that this is not a control, it's a mixin interface that classes
    have to derive from in addition to wxControl or wxWindow. Convenience
    class wxControlWithItems is provided for this purpose.
