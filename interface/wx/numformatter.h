    Helper class for formatting and parsing numbers with thousands separators.

    but directly call the member functions.

        By default, the string will use thousands separators if appropriate for
        the current locale. This can be avoided by passing Style_None as @a
        flags in which case the call to the function has exactly the same
        effect as <code>wxString::Format("%ld", val)</code>.

        Notice that calling ToString() with a value of type @c int and
        non-default flags results in ambiguity between this overload and the
        one below. To resolve it, you need to cast the value to @c long.

        @param val

        @param flags
            Combination of values from the Style enumeration (except for
            Style_NoTrailingZeroes which can't be used with this overload).

        available since wxWidgets 3.1.5. Also, unlike wxString::ToULongLong()

        @em not accept, i.e. returns @false, for the strings starting with the
        minus sign.
