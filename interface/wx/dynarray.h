/**
    The legacy dynamic array class, existing for compatibility only and @e NOT
    to be used in the new code.

    This section describes the so called @e "dynamic arrays". This is a C
    array-like type safe data structure i.e. the member access time is constant
    (and not linear according to the number of container elements as for linked
    lists). However, these arrays are dynamic in the sense that they will
    automatically allocate more memory if there is not enough of it for adding
    a new element. They also perform range checking on the index values but in
    debug mode only, so please be sure to compile your application in debug
    mode to use it (see @ref overview_debugging for details). So, unlike the
    arrays in some other languages, attempt to access an element beyond the
    arrays bound doesn't automatically expand the array but provokes an
    assertion failure instead in debug build and does nothing (except possibly
    crashing your program) in the release build.

    The array classes were designed to be reasonably efficient, both in terms
    of run-time speed and memory consumption and the executable size. The speed
    of array item access is, of course, constant (independent of the number of
    elements) making them much more efficient than linked lists (wxList).
    Adding items to the arrays is also implemented in more or less constant
    time, but the price is preallocating the memory in advance. In the
    "memory management" function section, you may find some useful hints about
    optimizing wxArray memory usage. As for executable size, all wxArray
    functions are inline, so they do not take @e any space at all.

    wxWidgets has three different kinds of array. All of them derive from
    wxBaseArray class which works with untyped data and cannot be used
    directly. The standard macros WX_DEFINE_ARRAY(), WX_DEFINE_SORTED_ARRAY()
    and WX_DEFINE_OBJARRAY() are used to define a new class deriving from it.
    The classes declared will be called in this documentation wxArray,
    wxSortedArray and wxObjArray but you should keep in mind that no classes
    with such names actually exist, each time you use one of the
    WX_DEFINE_XXXARRAY() macros, you define a class with a new name. In fact,
    these names are "template" names and each usage of one of the macros
    mentioned above creates a template specialization for the given element
    type.

    wxArray is suitable for storing integer types and pointers which it does
    not treat as objects in any way, i.e. the element pointed to by the pointer
    is not deleted when the element is removed from the array. It should be
    noted that all of wxArray's functions are inline, so it costs strictly
    nothing to define as many array types as you want (either in terms of the
    executable size or the speed) as long as at least one of them is defined
    and this is always the case because wxArrays are used by wxWidgets
    internally. This class has one serious limitation: it can only be used for
    storing integral types (bool, char, short, int, long and their unsigned
    variants) or pointers (of any kind). An attempt to use with objects of
    @c sizeof() greater than @c sizeof(long) will provoke a runtime assertion
    failure, however declaring a wxArray of floats will not (on the machines
    where @c "sizeof(float) <= sizeof(long)"), yet it will @b not work, please
    use wxObjArray for storing floats and doubles.

    wxSortedArray is a wxArray variant which should be used when searching in
    the array is a frequently used operation. It requires you to define an
    additional function for comparing two elements of the array element type
    and always stores its items in the sorted order (according to this
    function). Thus, its Index() function execution time is @c "O(log(N))"
    instead of @c "O(N)" for the usual arrays but the Add() method is slower:
    it is @c "O(log(N))" instead of constant time (neglecting time spent in
    memory allocation routine). However, in a usual situation elements are
    added to an array much less often than searched inside it, so wxSortedArray
    may lead to huge performance improvements compared to wxArray. Finally, it
    should be noticed that, as wxArray, wxSortedArray can be only used for
    storing integral types or pointers.

    wxObjArray class treats its elements like "objects". It may delete them
    when they are removed from the array (invoking the correct destructor) and
    copies them using the objects copy constructor. In order to implement this
    behaviour the definition of the wxObjArray arrays is split in two parts:
    first, you should declare the new wxObjArray class using the
    WX_DECLARE_OBJARRAY() macro and then you must include the file defining the
    implementation of template type: @<wx/arrimpl.cpp@> and define the array
    class with the WX_DEFINE_OBJARRAY() macro from a point where the full (as
    opposed to 'forward') declaration of the array elements class is in scope.
    As it probably sounds very complicated here is an example:

    @code
    #include <wx/dynarray.h>

    // We must forward declare the array because it is used
    // inside the class declaration.
    class MyDirectory;
    class MyFile;

    // This defines two new types: ArrayOfDirectories and ArrayOfFiles which
    // can be now used as shown below.
    WX_DECLARE_OBJARRAY(MyDirectory, ArrayOfDirectories);
    WX_DECLARE_OBJARRAY(MyFile,      ArrayOfFiles);

    class MyDirectory
    {
        // ...
        ArrayOfDirectories m_subdirectories; // All subdirectories
        ArrayOfFiles       m_files;          // All files in this directory
    };

    // ...

    // Now that we have MyDirectory declaration in scope we may finish the
    // definition of ArrayOfDirectories -- note that this expands into some C++
    // code and so should only be compiled once (i.e., don't put this in the
    // header, but into a source file or you will get linking errors)
    #include <wx/arrimpl.cpp> // This is a magic incantation which must be done!
    WX_DEFINE_OBJARRAY(ArrayOfDirectories);

    // that's all!
    @endcode

    It is not as elegant as writing this:

    @code
    typedef std::vector<MyDirectory> ArrayOfDirectories;
    @endcode

    But is not that complicated and allows the code to be compiled with any,
    however dumb, C++ compiler in the world.

    Remember to include @<wx/arrimpl.cpp@> just before each
    WX_DEFINE_OBJARRAY() occurrence in your code, even if you have several in
    the same file.

    Things are much simpler for wxArray and wxSortedArray however: it is enough
    just to write:

    @code
    WX_DEFINE_ARRAY_INT(int, ArrayOfInts);
    WX_DEFINE_SORTED_ARRAY_INT(int, ArrayOfSortedInts);
    @endcode

    There is only one @c DEFINE macro and no need for separate @c DECLARE one.
    For the arrays of the primitive types, the macros
    @c WX_DEFINE_ARRAY_CHAR/SHORT/INT/SIZE_T/LONG/DOUBLE should be used
    depending on the sizeof of the values (notice that storing values of
    smaller type, e.g. shorts, in an array of larger one, e.g. @c ARRAY_INT,
    does not work on all architectures!).


    @section array_macros Macros for Template Array Definition

    To use an array you must first define the array class. This is done with
    the help of the macros in this section. The class of array elements must be
    (at least) forward declared for WX_DEFINE_ARRAY(), WX_DEFINE_SORTED_ARRAY()
    and WX_DECLARE_OBJARRAY() macros and must be fully declared before you use
    WX_DEFINE_OBJARRAY() macro.

    - WX_DEFINE_ARRAY()
    - WX_DEFINE_EXPORTED_ARRAY()
    - WX_DEFINE_USER_EXPORTED_ARRAY()
    - WX_DEFINE_SORTED_ARRAY()
    - WX_DEFINE_SORTED_EXPORTED_ARRAY()
    - WX_DEFINE_SORTED_USER_EXPORTED_ARRAY()
    - WX_DECLARE_EXPORTED_OBJARRAY()
    - WX_DECLARE_USER_EXPORTED_OBJARRAY()
    - WX_DEFINE_OBJARRAY()
    - WX_DEFINE_EXPORTED_OBJARRAY()
    - WX_DEFINE_USER_EXPORTED_OBJARRAY()

    To slightly complicate the matters even further, the operator "->" defined
    by default for the array iterators by these macros only makes sense if the
    array element type is not a pointer itself and, although it still works,
    this provokes warnings from some compilers and to avoid them you should use
    the @c _PTR versions of the macros above. For example, to define an array
    of pointers to @c double you should use:

    @code
    WX_DEFINE_ARRAY_PTR(double *, MyArrayOfDoublePointers);
    @endcode

    Note that the above macros are generally only useful for wxObject types.
    There are separate macros for declaring an array of a simple type, such as
    an int.

    The following simple types are supported:
    - @c int
    - @c long
    - @c size_t
    - @c double

    To create an array of a simple type, simply append the type you want in
    CAPS to the array definition.

    For example, you'd use one of the following variants for an integer array:

    - WX_DEFINE_ARRAY_INT()
    - WX_DEFINE_EXPORTED_ARRAY_INT()
    - WX_DEFINE_USER_EXPORTED_ARRAY_INT()
    - WX_DEFINE_SORTED_ARRAY_INT()
    - WX_DEFINE_SORTED_EXPORTED_ARRAY_INT()
    - WX_DEFINE_SORTED_USER_EXPORTED_ARRAY_INT()


    @section array_predef Predefined array types

    wxWidgets defines the following dynamic array types:
    - ::wxArrayShort
    - ::wxArrayInt
    - ::wxArrayDouble
    - ::wxArrayLong
    - ::wxArrayPtrVoid

    To use them you don't need any macro; you just need to include @c dynarray.h.

        items. However, for memory-efficiency sake, neither of these classes
