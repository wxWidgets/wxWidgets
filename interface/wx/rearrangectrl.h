/**
    @class wxRearrangeList

    A listbox-like control allowing the user to rearrange the items and to
    enable or disable them.

    This class allows to change the order of the items shown in it as well as
    to check or uncheck them individually. The data structure used to allow
    this is the order array which contains the items indices indexed by their
    position with an added twist that the unchecked items are represented by
    the bitwise complement of the corresponding index (for any architecture
    using two's complement for negative numbers representation (i.e. just about
    any at all) this means that a checked item N is represented by -N-1 in
    unchecked state). In practice this means that you must apply the C bitwise
    complement operator when constructing the order array, e.g.
    @code
        wxArrayInt order;
        order.push_back(0); // checked item #0
        order.push_back(~1); // unchecked item #1
    @endcode

    So, for example, the array order [1 -3 0] used in conjunction with the
    items array ["first", "second", "third"] means that the items order is
    "second", "third", "first" and the "third" item is unchecked while the
    other two are checked.

    This convention is used both for the order argument of the control ctor or
    Create() and for the array returned from GetCurrentOrder().

    Usually this control will be used together with other controls allowing to
    move the items around in it interactively. The simplest possible solution
    is to use wxRearrangeCtrl which combines it with two standard buttons to
    move the current item up or down.

    Note that while most of the methods for items manipulation such as
    Append(), Insert() or Delete(), inherited from wxItemContainer work as
    expected for this class, Set() somewhat unexpectedly resets the order of
    the items as it clears the control first, also clearing the order as a side
    effect, before adding the new items.
