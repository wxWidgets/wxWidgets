    @class wxSizer

    wxSizer is the abstract base class used for laying out subwindows in a window.
    You cannot use wxSizer directly; instead, you will have to use one of the sizer
    classes derived from it. Currently there are wxBoxSizer, wxStaticBoxSizer,
    wxGridSizer, wxFlexGridSizer, wxWrapSizer and wxGridBagSizer.

    The layout algorithm used by sizers in wxWidgets is closely related to layout
    in other GUI toolkits, such as Java's AWT, the GTK toolkit or the Qt toolkit.
    It is based upon the idea of the individual subwindows reporting their minimal
    required size and their ability to get stretched if the size of the parent window
    has changed.

    This will most often mean that the programmer does not set the original size of
    a dialog in the beginning, rather the dialog will be assigned a sizer and this
    sizer will be queried about the recommended size. The sizer in turn will query
    its children, which can be normal windows, empty space or other sizers, so that
    a hierarchy of sizers can be constructed. Note that wxSizer does not derive
    from wxWindow and thus does not interfere with tab ordering and requires very little
    resources compared to a real window on screen.

    What makes sizers so well fitted for use in wxWidgets is the fact that every
    control reports its own minimal size and the algorithm can handle differences in
    font sizes or different window (dialog item) sizes on different platforms without
    problems. If e.g. the standard font as well as the overall design of Motif widgets
    requires more space than on Windows, the initial dialog size will automatically
    be bigger on Motif than on Windows.

    Sizers may also be used to control the layout of custom drawn items on the
    window. The wxSizer::Add(), wxSizer::Insert(), and wxSizer::Prepend() functions
    return a pointer to the newly added wxSizerItem.
    Just add empty space of the desired size and attributes, and then use the
    wxSizerItem::GetRect() method to determine where the drawing operations
    should take place.

    Please notice that sizers, like child windows, are owned by the library and
    will be deleted by it which implies that they must be allocated on the heap.
    However if you create a sizer and do not add it to another sizer or
    window, the library wouldn't be able to delete such an orphan sizer and in
    this, and only this, case it should be deleted explicitly.

    @section wxsizer_flags wxSizer flags

    The "flag" argument accepted by wxSizerItem constructors and other
    functions, e.g. wxSizer::Add(), is an OR-combination of the following flags.
    Two main behaviours are defined using these flags. One is the border around
    a window: the border parameter determines the border width whereas the
    flags given here determine which side(s) of the item that the border will
    be added.  The other flags determine how the sizer item behaves when the
    space allotted to the sizer changes, and is somewhat dependent on the
    specific kind of sizer used.

    @beginDefList
    @itemdef{wxTOP<br>
             wxBOTTOM<br>
             wxLEFT<br>
             wxRIGHT<br>
             wxALL,
             These flags are used to specify which side(s) of the sizer item
             the border width will apply to.}
    @itemdef{wxEXPAND,
             The item will be expanded to fill the space assigned to the item.
             When used for the items of wxBoxSizer, the expansion only happens
             in the transversal direction of the sizer as only the item
             proportion governs its behaviour in the principal sizer direction.
             But when it is used for the items of wxGridSizer, this flag can be
             combined with the alignment flags which override it in the
             corresponding direction if specified, e.g. @c wxEXPAND |
             wxALIGN_CENTRE_VERTICAL would expand the item only horizontally
             but center it vertically. Notice that this doesn't work for the
             default left/top alignment and @c wxEXPAND still applies in both
             directions if it is combined with @c wxALIGN_LEFT or @c wxALIGN_TOP.}
    @itemdef{wxSHAPED,
             The item will be expanded as much as possible while also
             maintaining its aspect ratio.}
    @itemdef{wxFIXED_MINSIZE,
             Normally sizers use the "best", i.e. most appropriate, size of the
             window to determine what the minimal size of window items should be.
             This allows layouts to adjust correctly when the item contents,
             and hence its best size, changes. If this behaviour is unwanted,
             @c wxFIXED_MINSIZE can be used to fix minimal size of the window
             to its initial value and not change it any more in the future.
             Note that the same thing can be accomplished by calling
             wxWindow::SetMinSize() explicitly as well.}
    @itemdef{wxRESERVE_SPACE_EVEN_IF_HIDDEN,
             Normally wxSizers don't allocate space for hidden windows or other
             items. This flag overrides this behaviour so that sufficient space
             is allocated for the window even if it isn't visible. This makes
             it possible to dynamically show and hide controls without resizing
             parent dialog, for example. (Available since 2.8.8.)}
    @itemdef{wxALIGN_CENTER<br>
             wxALIGN_CENTRE<br>
             wxALIGN_LEFT<br>
             wxALIGN_RIGHT<br>
             wxALIGN_TOP<br>
             wxALIGN_BOTTOM<br>
             wxALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL<br>
             wxALIGN_CENTRE_VERTICAL<br>
             wxALIGN_CENTER_HORIZONTAL<br>
             wxALIGN_CENTRE_HORIZONTAL,
             The @c wxALIGN_* flags allow you to specify the alignment of the item
             within the space allotted to it by the sizer, adjusted for the
             border if any.}

    standard dialogs look correct on all major platforms. Currently it conforms to
    the Windows, GTK+ and macOS human interface guidelines.

    When there aren't interface guidelines defined for a particular platform or
    toolkit, wxStdDialogButtonSizer reverts to the Windows implementation.

    To use this class, first add buttons to the sizer by calling
    wxStdDialogButtonSizer::AddButton (or wxStdDialogButtonSizer::SetAffirmativeButton,
    wxStdDialogButtonSizer::SetNegativeButton or wxStdDialogButtonSizer::SetCancelButton)
    and then call Realize in order to create the actual button layout used.
    Other than these special operations, this sizer works like any other sizer.

    If you add a button with wxID_SAVE, on macOS the button will be renamed to
    "Save" and the wxID_NO button will be renamed to "Don't Save" in accordance
    with the macOS Human Interface Guidelines.

/**
    @class wxSizerFlags

    Container for sizer items flags providing readable names for them.

    Normally, when you add an item to a sizer via wxSizer::Add, you have to
    specify a lot of flags and parameters which can be unwieldy. This is where
    wxSizerFlags comes in: it allows you to specify all parameters using the
    named methods instead. For example, instead of

    @code
    sizer->Add(ctrl, 0, wxEXPAND | wxALL, 10);
    @endcode

    you can now write

    @code
    sizer->Add(ctrl, wxSizerFlags().Expand().Border(wxALL, 10));
    @endcode

    This is more readable and also allows you to create wxSizerFlags objects which
    can be reused for several sizer items.

    @code
    wxSizerFlags flagsExpand(1);
        flagsExpand.Expand().Border(wxALL, 10);

        sizer->Add(ctrl1, flagsExpand);
        sizer->Add(ctrl2, flagsExpand);
    @endcode

    Note that by specification, all methods of wxSizerFlags return the wxSizerFlags
    object itself to allowing chaining multiple methods calls like in the examples
    above.

/**
    @class wxStaticBoxSizer

    wxStaticBoxSizer is a sizer derived from wxBoxSizer but adds a static box around
    the sizer.

    The static box may be either created independently or the sizer may create it
    itself as a convenience. In any case, the sizer owns the wxStaticBox control
    and will delete it in the wxStaticBoxSizer destructor.

    Note that since wxWidgets 2.9.1 you are strongly encouraged to create the windows
    which are added to wxStaticBoxSizer as children of wxStaticBox itself, see
    this class documentation for more details.

    Example of use of this class:
    @code
        void MyFrame::CreateControls()
        {
            wxPanel *panel = new wxPanel(this);
            ...
            wxStaticBoxSizer *sz = new wxStaticBoxSizer(wxVERTICAL, panel, "Box");
            sz->Add(new wxStaticText(sz->GetStaticBox(), wxID_ANY,
                                     "This window is a child of the staticbox"));
            ...
        }
    @endcode
