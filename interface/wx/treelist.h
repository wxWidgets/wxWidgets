/**
    @class wxTreeListCtrl

    A control combining wxTreeCtrl and wxListCtrl features.

    This is a multi-column tree control optionally supporting images and
    checkboxes for the items in the first column.

    It is currently implemented using wxDataViewCtrl internally but provides a
    much simpler interface for the common use case it addresses. Thus, one of
    the design principles for this control is simplicity and intentionally
    doesn't provide all the features of wxDataViewCtrl. Most importantly, this
    class stores all its data internally and doesn't require you to define a
    custom model for it.

    Instead, this controls works like wxTreeCtrl or non-virtual wxListCtrl and
    allows you to simply add items to it using wxTreeListCtrl::AppendItem() and
    related methods. Typically, you start by setting up the columns (you must
    have at least one) by calling wxTreeListCtrl::AppendColumn() and then add
    the items. While only the text of the first column can be specified when
    adding them, you can use wxTreeListCtrl::SetItemText() to set the text of
    the other columns.


    Unlike wxTreeCtrl or wxListCtrl this control can sort its items on its own.
    To allow user to sort the control contents by clicking on some column you
    should use wxCOL_SORTABLE flag when adding that column to the control. When
    a column with this flag is clicked, the control resorts itself using the
    values in this column. By default the sort is done using alphabetical order
    comparison of the items text, which is not always correct (e.g. this
    doesn't work for the numeric columns). To change this you may use
    SetItemComparator() method to provide a custom comparator, i.e. simply an
    object that implements comparison between the two items. The treelist
    sample shows an example of doing this. And if you need to sort the control
    programmatically, you can call SetSortColumn() method.


    Here are the styles supported by this control. Notice that using
    wxTL_USER_3STATE implies wxTL_3STATE and wxTL_3STATE in turn implies
    wxTL_CHECKBOX.

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxTL_SINGLE}
        Single selection, this is the default.
    @style{wxTL_MULTIPLE}
        Allow multiple selection, see GetSelections().
    @style{wxTL_CHECKBOX}
        Show the usual, 2 state, checkboxes for the items in the first column.
    @style{wxTL_3STATE}
        Show the checkboxes that can possibly be set by the program, but not
        the user, to a third, undetermined, state, for the items in the first
        column. Implies wxTL_CHECKBOX.
    @style{wxTL_USER_3STATE}
        Same as wxTL_3STATE but the user can also set the checkboxes to the
        undetermined state. Implies wxTL_3STATE.
    @style{wxTL_NO_HEADER}
        Don't show the column headers, that are shown by default. Notice that
        this style is only available since wxWidgets 2.9.5.
    @style{wxTL_DEFAULT_STYLE}
        Style used by the control by default, just wxTL_SINGLE currently.
    @endStyleTable

    @beginEventTable{wxTreeListEvent}
    @event{EVT_TREELIST_SELECTION_CHANGED(id, func)}
        Process @c wxEVT_TREELIST_SELECTION_CHANGED event and notifies
        about the selection change in the control. In the single selection case
        the item indicated by the event has been selected and previously
        selected item, if any, was deselected. In multiple selection case, the
        selection of this item has just changed (it may have been either
        selected or deselected) but notice that the selection of other items
        could have changed as well, use wxTreeListCtrl::GetSelections() to
        retrieve the new selection if necessary.
    @event{EVT_TREELIST_ITEM_EXPANDING(id, func)}
        Process @c wxEVT_TREELIST_ITEM_EXPANDING event notifying about
        the given branch being expanded. This event is sent before the
        expansion occurs and can be vetoed to prevent it from happening.
    @event{EVT_TREELIST_ITEM_EXPANDED(id, func)}
        Process @c wxEVT_TREELIST_ITEM_EXPANDED event notifying about
        the expansion of the given branch. This event is sent after the
        expansion occurs and can't be vetoed.
    @event{EVT_TREELIST_ITEM_CHECKED(id, func)}
        Process @c wxEVT_TREELIST_ITEM_CHECKED event notifying about
        the user checking or unchecking the item. You can use
        wxTreeListCtrl::GetCheckedState() to retrieve the new item state and
        wxTreeListEvent::GetOldCheckedState() to get the previous one.
    @event{EVT_TREELIST_ITEM_ACTIVATED(id, func)}
        Process @c wxEVT_TREELIST_ITEM_ACTIVATED event notifying about
        the user double clicking the item or activating it from keyboard.
    @event{EVT_TREELIST_ITEM_CONTEXT_MENU(id, func)}
        Process @c wxEVT_TREELIST_ITEM_CONTEXT_MENU event indicating
        that the popup menu for the given item should be displayed.
    @event{EVT_TREELIST_COLUMN_SORTED(id, func)}
        Process @c wxEVT_TREELIST_COLUMN_SORTED event indicating that
        the control contents has just been resorted using the specified column.
        The event doesn't carry the sort direction, use GetSortColumn() method
        if you need to know it.
