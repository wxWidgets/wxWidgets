    @class wxDateTime

    wxDateTime class represents an absolute moment in time.

    The type @c wxDateTime_t is typedefed as <tt>unsigned short</tt> and is
    used to contain the number of years, hours, minutes, seconds and
    milliseconds.

    Global constant ::wxDefaultDateTime and synonym for it ::wxInvalidDateTime are
    defined. This constant will be different from any valid wxDateTime object.


    @section datetime_static Static Functions

    All static functions either set or return the static variables of
    wxDateSpan (the country), return the current moment, year, month or number
    of days in it, or do some general calendar-related actions.

    Please note that although several function accept an extra Calendar
    parameter, it is currently ignored as only the Gregorian calendar is
    supported. Future versions will support other calendars.

    @section datetime_formatting Date Formatting and Parsing

    The date formatting and parsing functions convert wxDateTime objects to and
    from text. The conversions to text are mostly trivial: you can either do it
    using the default date and time representations for the current locale
    (FormatDate() and FormatTime()), using the international standard
    representation defined by ISO 8601 (FormatISODate(), FormatISOTime() and
    FormatISOCombined()) or by specifying any format at all and using Format()
    directly.

    The conversions from text are more interesting, as there are much more
    possibilities to care about. The simplest cases can be taken care of with
    ParseFormat() which can parse any date in the given (rigid) format.
    ParseRfc822Date() is another function for parsing dates in predefined
    format -- the one of RFC 822 which (still...) defines the format of email
    messages on the Internet. This format cannot be described with
    @c strptime(3)-like format strings used by Format(), hence the need for a
    separate function.

    But the most interesting functions are ParseTime(), ParseDate() and
    ParseDateTime(). They try to parse the date and time (or only one of them)
    in 'free' format, i.e. allow them to be specified in any of possible ways.
    These functions will usually be used to parse the (interactive) user input
    which is not bound to be in any predefined format. As an example,
    ParseDate() can parse the strings such as "tomorrow", "March first" and
    even "next Sunday".

    Finally notice that each of the parsing functions is available in several
    overloads: if the input string is a narrow (@c char *) string, then a
    narrow pointer is returned. If the input string is a wide string, a wide
    char pointer is returned. Finally, if the input parameter is a wxString, a
    narrow char pointer is also returned for backwards compatibility but there
    is also an additional argument of wxString::const_iterator type in which,
    if it is not @NULL, an iterator pointing to the end of the scanned string
    part is returned.

/**
    @class wxDateSpan

    This class is a "logical time span" and is useful for implementing program
    logic for such things as "add one month to the date" which, in general,
    doesn't mean to add 60*60*24*31 seconds to it, but to take the same date
    the next month (to understand that this is indeed different consider adding
    one month to Feb, 15 -- we want to get Mar, 15, of course).

    When adding a month to the date, all lesser components (days, hours, ...)
    won't be changed unless the resulting date would be invalid: for example,
    Jan 31 + 1 month will be Feb 28, not (non-existing) Feb 31.

    Because of this feature, adding and subtracting back again the same
    wxDateSpan will @b not, in general, give back the original date: Feb 28 - 1
    month will be Jan 28, not Jan 31!

    wxDateSpan objects can be either positive or negative. They may be
    multiplied by scalars which multiply all deltas by the scalar: i.e.
    2*(1  month and  1  day) is 2 months and 2 days. They can be added together
    with wxDateTime or wxTimeSpan, but the type of result is different for each
    case.

    @warning If you specify both weeks and days, the total number of days added
             will be 7*weeks + days! See also GetTotalDays().

    Equality operators are defined for wxDateSpans. Two wxDateSpans are equal
    if and only if they both give the same target date when added to @b every
    source date. Thus wxDateSpan::Months(1) is not equal to
    wxDateSpan::Days(30), because they don't give the same date when added to
    Feb 1st. But wxDateSpan::Days(14) is equal to wxDateSpan::Weeks(2).

    Finally, notice that for adding hours, minutes and so on you don't need
    this class at all: wxTimeSpan will do the job because there are no
    subtleties associated with those (we don't support leap seconds).
