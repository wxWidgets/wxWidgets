/**
    @class wxBrush

    A brush is a drawing tool for filling in areas. It is used for painting
    the background of rectangles, ellipses, etc. It has a colour and a style.

    On a monochrome display, wxWidgets shows all brushes as white unless the
    colour is really black.

    Do not initialize objects on the stack before the program commences, since
    other required structures may not have been set up yet. Instead, define
    global pointers to objects and create them in wxApp::OnInit or when required.

    An application may wish to create brushes with different characteristics
    dynamically, and there is the consequent danger that a large number of
    duplicate brushes will be created. Therefore an application may wish to
    get a pointer to a brush by using the global list of brushes ::wxTheBrushList,
    and calling the member function wxBrushList::FindOrCreateBrush().

    This class uses reference counting and copy-on-write internally so that
    assignments between two instances of this class are very cheap.
    You can therefore use actual objects instead of pointers without efficiency problems.
    If an instance of this class is changed it will create its own data internally
    so that other instances, which previously shared the data using the reference
    counting, are not affected.
