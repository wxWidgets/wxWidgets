/**
    @class wxWindow

    wxWindow is the base class for all windows and represents any visible object
    on screen. All controls, top level windows and so on are windows. Sizers and
    device contexts are not, however, as they don't appear on screen themselves.

    Please note that all children of the window will be deleted automatically by
    the destructor before the window itself is deleted which means that you don't
    have to worry about deleting them manually. Please see the @ref
    overview_windowdeletion "window deletion overview" for more information.

    Also note that in this, and many others, wxWidgets classes some
    @c GetXXX() methods may be overloaded (as, for example,
    wxWindow::GetSize or wxWindow::GetClientSize). In this case, the overloads
    are non-virtual because having multiple virtual functions with the same name
    results in a virtual function name hiding at the derived class level (in
    English, this means that the derived class has to override all overloaded
    variants if it overrides any of them). To allow overriding them in the derived
    class, wxWidgets uses a unique protected virtual @c DoGetXXX() method
    and all @c GetXXX() ones are forwarded to it, so overriding the former
    changes the behaviour of the latter.

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxBORDER_DEFAULT}
           The window class will decide the kind of border to show, if any.
    @style{wxBORDER_SIMPLE}
           Displays a thin border around the window. wxSIMPLE_BORDER is the
           old name for this style.
    @style{wxBORDER_SUNKEN}
           Displays a sunken border. wxSUNKEN_BORDER is the old name for this
           style.
    @style{wxBORDER_RAISED}
           Displays a raised border. wxRAISED_BORDER is the old name for this
           style.
    @style{wxBORDER_STATIC}
           Displays a border suitable for a static control.  wxSTATIC_BORDER
           is the old name for this style. Windows only.
    @style{wxBORDER_THEME}
           Displays a native border suitable for a control, on the current
           platform. On Windows, this will be a themed border; on
           most other platforms a sunken border will be used. For more
           information for themed borders on Windows, please see Themed
           borders on Windows.
    @style{wxBORDER_NONE}
           Displays no border, overriding the default border style for the
           window. wxNO_BORDER is the old name for this style.
    @style{wxBORDER_DOUBLE}
           This style is obsolete and should not be used.
    @style{wxTRANSPARENT_WINDOW}
           The window is transparent, that is, it will not receive paint
           events. Windows only.
    @style{wxTAB_TRAVERSAL}
           This style is used by wxWidgets for the windows supporting TAB
           navigation among their children, such as wxDialog and wxPanel. It
           should almost never be used in the application code.
    @style{wxWANTS_CHARS}
           Use this to indicate that the window wants to get all char/key
           events for all keys - even for keys like TAB or ENTER which are
           usually used for dialog navigation and which wouldn't be generated
           without this style.  If you need to use this style in order to get
           the arrows or etc., but would still like to have normal keyboard
           navigation take place, you should call Navigate in response to the
           key events for Tab and Shift-Tab.
    @style{wxNO_FULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE}
           On Windows, this style used to disable repainting the window
           completely when its size is changed. Since this behaviour is now
           the default, the style is now obsolete and no longer has an effect.
    @style{wxVSCROLL}
           Use this style to enable a vertical scrollbar. Notice that this
           style cannot be used with native controls which don't support
           scrollbars nor with top-level windows in most ports.
    @style{wxHSCROLL}
           Use this style to enable a horizontal scrollbar. The same
           limitations as for wxVSCROLL apply to this style.
    @style{wxALWAYS_SHOW_SB}
           If a window has scrollbars, disable them instead of hiding them
           when they are not needed (i.e. when the size of the window is big
           enough to not require the scrollbars to navigate it). This style is
           currently implemented for wxMSW, wxGTK and wxUniversal and does
           nothing on the other platforms.
    @style{wxCLIP_CHILDREN}
           Use this style to eliminate flicker caused by the background being
           repainted, then children being painted over them. Windows only.
    @style{wxFULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE}
           Use this style to force a complete redraw of the window whenever it
           is resized instead of redrawing just the part of the window
           affected by resizing. Note that this was the behaviour by default
           before 2.5.1 release and that if you experience redraw problems
           with code which previously used to work you may want to try this.
           Currently this style applies on GTK+ 2 and Windows only, and full
           repainting is always done on other platforms.
    @endStyleTable

    @beginExtraStyleTable
    @style{wxWS_EX_BLOCK_EVENTS}
           wxCommandEvents and the objects of the derived classes are
           forwarded to the parent window and so on recursively by default.
           Using this flag for the given window allows to block this
           propagation at this window, i.e. prevent the events from being
           propagated further upwards. Dialogs have this flag on by default
           for the reasons explained in the @ref overview_events.
    @style{wxWS_EX_TRANSIENT}
           Don't use this window as an implicit parent for the other windows:
           this must be used with transient windows as otherwise there is the
           risk of creating a dialog/frame with this window as a parent, which
           would lead to a crash if the parent were destroyed before the child.
    @style{wxWS_EX_CONTEXTHELP}
           Under Windows, puts a query button on the caption. When pressed,
           Windows will go into a context-sensitive help mode and wxWidgets
           will send a @c wxEVT_HELP event if the user clicked on an application window.
           This style cannot be used (because of the underlying native behaviour)
           together with @c wxMAXIMIZE_BOX or @c wxMINIMIZE_BOX, so these two styles
           are automatically turned off if this one is used.
    @style{wxWS_EX_PROCESS_IDLE}
           This window should always process idle events, even if the mode set
           by wxIdleEvent::SetMode is @c wxIDLE_PROCESS_SPECIFIED.
    @style{wxWS_EX_PROCESS_UI_UPDATES}
           This window should always process UI update events, even if the
           mode set by wxUpdateUIEvent::SetMode is @c wxUPDATE_UI_PROCESS_SPECIFIED.

            You would use:
            @code
            SetScrollbar(wxVERTICAL, 0, 16, 50);
            @endcode
            Note that with the window at this size, the thumb position can never
            go above 50 minus 16, or 34. You can determine how many lines are
            currently visible by dividing the current view size by the character
            height in pixels.
            When defining your own scrollbar behaviour, you will always need
            to recalculate the scrollbar settings when the window size changes.
            You could therefore put your scrollbar calculations and SetScrollbar
            call into a function named AdjustScrollbars, which can be called

    /**

        The default background style is @c wxBG_STYLE_ERASE which indicates that
        the window background may be erased in @c EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND handler.
        This is a safe, compatibility default; however you may want to change it
        to @c wxBG_STYLE_SYSTEM if you don't define any erase background event
        handlers at all, to avoid unnecessary generation of erase background
        events and always let system erase the background. And you should
        change the background style to @c wxBG_STYLE_PAINT if you define an
        @c EVT_PAINT handler which completely overwrites the window background as
        in this case erasing it previously, either in @c EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND
        handler or in the system default handler, would result in flicker as
        the background pixels will be repainted twice every time the window is
        redrawn. Do ensure that the background is entirely erased by your
        @c EVT_PAINT handler in this case however as otherwise garbage may be left
        on screen.

        Notice that in previous versions of wxWidgets a common way to work
        around the above mentioned flickering problem was to define an empty
        @c EVT_ERASE_BACKGROUND handler. Setting background style to
        @c wxBG_STYLE_PAINT is a simpler and more efficient solution to the same
        problem.


        Under wxGTK and wxOSX, you can use ::wxBG_STYLE_TRANSPARENT to obtain
        full transparency of the window background. Note that wxGTK supports
        this only since GTK 2.12 with a compositing manager enabled, call
        IsTransparentBackgroundSupported() to check whether this is the case.

        Also, in order for @c SetBackgroundStyle(wxBG_STYLE_TRANSPARENT) to

                    Create(parent, ...);

        than just scaled down or up version of the normal variant, so it should
        be preferred to directly tweaking the font size.

                 the window. Usually it is only used with the top level
                 windows (wxFrame and wxDialog classes) as the others
                 are not supposed to have any special OnClose() logic.
                The close handler should check whether the window is being deleted
                forcibly, using wxCloseEvent::CanVeto, in which case it should
                destroy the window using wxWindow::Destroy.

        Returns the default font and colours which are used by the control.

        This is useful if you want to use the same font or colour in your own control
        as in a standard control -- which is a much better idea than hard coding specific
        colours or fonts which might look completely out of place on the users
        system, especially if it uses themes.

        The @a variant parameter is only relevant under Mac currently and is
        ignore under other platforms. Under Mac, it will change the size of the
        returned font. See SetWindowVariant() for more about this.

        This static method is "overridden" in many derived classes and so calling,
        for example, wxButton::GetClassDefaultAttributes() will typically
        return the values appropriate for a button which will be normally different
        from those returned by, say, wxListCtrl::GetClassDefaultAttributes().

        The @c wxVisualAttributes structure has at least the fields
        @c font, @c colFg and @c colBg. All of them may be invalid
        if it was not possible to determine the default control appearance or,
        especially for the background colour, if the field doesn't make sense as is
        the case for @c colBg for the controls with themed background.

           enough to show all the children.

           used as its best size.

        The default implementation simply returns ::wxDefaultSize and
        GetBestSize() returns an arbitrary hardcoded size for the window, so
        you must override it when implementing a custom window class.

        Notice that the best size returned by this function is cached
        internally, so if anything that results in the best size changing (e.g.
        change to the control contents) happens, you need to call
