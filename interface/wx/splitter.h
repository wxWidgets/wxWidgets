    @class wxSplitterWindow

    This class manages up to two subwindows. The current view can be split
    into two programmatically (perhaps from a menu command), and unsplit
    either programmatically or via the wxSplitterWindow user interface.

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxSP_3D}
           Draws a 3D effect border and sash.
    @style{wxSP_THIN_SASH}
           Draws a thin sash.
    @style{wxSP_3DSASH}
           Draws a 3D effect sash (part of default style).
    @style{wxSP_3DBORDER}
           Synonym for wxSP_BORDER.
    @style{wxSP_BORDER}
           Draws a standard border.
    @style{wxSP_NOBORDER}
           No border (default).
    @style{wxSP_NO_XP_THEME}
           Under Windows, switches off the attempt to draw the splitter
           using Windows theming, so the borders and sash will take on the
           pre-XP look.
    @style{wxSP_PERMIT_UNSPLIT}
           Always allow to unsplit, even with the minimum pane size other than zero.
    @style{wxSP_LIVE_UPDATE}
           Don't draw XOR line but resize the child windows immediately.
    @endStyleTable


    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxSplitterEvent}
    @event{EVT_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_CHANGING(id, func)}
        The sash position is in the process of being changed.
        May be used to modify the position of the tracking bar to properly
        reflect the position that would be set if the drag were to be completed
        at this point. Processes a @c wxEVT_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_CHANGING event.
    @event{EVT_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_RESIZE(id, func)}
        The sash position is in the process of being updated.
        May be used to modify the position of the tracking bar to properly
        reflect the position that would be set if the update were to be completed.
        This can happen e.g. when the window is resized and the sash is moved
        according to the gravity setting.
        This event is sent when the window is resized and allows the application to select
        the desired new sash position. If it doesn't process the event, the position
        is determined by the gravity setting.
        Processes a @c wxEVT_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_RESIZE event and is only
        available in wxWidgets 3.1.6 or newer.
    @event{EVT_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_CHANGED(id, func)}
        The sash position was changed. May be used to modify the sash position
        before it is set, or to prevent the change from taking place.
        Processes a @c wxEVT_SPLITTER_SASH_POS_CHANGED event.
    @event{EVT_SPLITTER_UNSPLIT(id, func)}
        The splitter has been just unsplit. Processes a @c wxEVT_SPLITTER_UNSPLIT event.
    @event{EVT_SPLITTER_DCLICK(id, func)}
        The sash was double clicked. The default behaviour is to unsplit the
        window when this happens (unless the minimum pane size has been set
        to a value greater than zero). Processes a @c wxEVT_SPLITTER_DOUBLECLICKED event.

        @remarks
        Gravity is real factor which controls position of sash while resizing
        wxSplitterWindow. Gravity tells wxSplitterWindow how much will left/top
        window grow while resizing.
        Example values:
        - 0.0: only the bottom/right window is automatically resized
        - 0.5: both windows grow by equal size
        - 1.0: only left/top window grows
        Gravity should be a real value between 0.0 and 1.0.
        Default value of sash gravity is 0.0.
        That value is compatible with previous (before gravity was introduced)
        behaviour of wxSplitterWindow.

        Notice that when sash gravity for a newly created splitter window, it
        is often necessary to explicitly set the splitter size using SetSize()
        to ensure that is big enough for its initial sash position. Otherwise,
        i.e. if the window is created with the default tiny size and only
        resized to its correct size later, the initial sash position will be
        affected by the gravity and typically result in sash being at the
        rightmost position for the gravity of 1. See the example code creating
        wxSplitterWindow in the splitter sample for more details.
