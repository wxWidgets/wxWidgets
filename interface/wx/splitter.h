    @class wxSplitterWindow

    @ref overview_wxsplitterwindowoverview "wxSplitterWindow overview"

    This class manages up to two subwindows. The current view can be
    split into two programmatically (perhaps from a menu command), and unsplit
    either programmatically or via the wxSplitterWindow user interface.

    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxSP_3D}
           Draws a 3D effect border and sash.
    @style{wxSP_THIN_SASH}
           Draws a thin sash.
    @style{wxSP_3DSASH}
           Draws a 3D effect sash (part of default style).
    @style{wxSP_3DBORDER}
           Synonym for wxSP_BORDER.
    @style{wxSP_BORDER}
           Draws a standard border.
    @style{wxSP_NOBORDER}
           No border (default).
    @style{wxSP_NO_XP_THEME}
           Under Windows XP, switches off the attempt to draw the splitter
           using Windows XP theming, so the borders and sash will take on the
           pre-XP look.
    @style{wxSP_PERMIT_UNSPLIT}
           Always allow to unsplit, even with the minimum pane size other than
           zero.
    @style{wxSP_LIVE_UPDATE}
           Don't draw XOR line but resize the child windows immediately.
