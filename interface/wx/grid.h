    derived classes or derive your own class from it.

/**
    Class providing attributes to be used for the grid cells.

    This class both defines an interface which grid cell attributes providers
    should implement -- and which can be implemented differently in derived
    classes -- and a default implementation of this interface which is often
    good enough to be used without modification, especially with not very large
    grids for which the efficiency of attributes storage hardly matters (see
    the discussion below).

    An object of this class can be associated with a wxGrid using
    wxGridTableBase::SetAttrProvider() but it's not necessary to call it if you
    intend to use the default provider as it is used by wxGridTableBase by
    default anyhow.

    Notice that while attributes provided by this class can be set for
    individual cells using SetAttr() or the entire rows or columns using
    SetRowAttr() and SetColAttr() they are always retrieved using GetAttr()
    function.


    The default implementation of this class stores the attributes passed to
    its SetAttr(), SetRowAttr() and SetColAttr() in a straightforward way. A
    derived class may use its knowledge about how the attributes are used in
    your program to implement it much more efficiently: for example, using a
    special background colour for all even-numbered rows can be implemented by
    simply returning the same attribute from GetAttr() if the row number is
    even instead of having to store N/2 row attributes where N is the total
    number of rows in the grid.

    Notice that objects of this class can't be copied.

/**
    @class wxGridTableBase

    The almost abstract base class for grid tables.

    A grid table is responsible for storing the grid data and, indirectly, grid
    cell attributes. The data can be stored in the way most convenient for the
    application but has to be provided in string form to wxGrid. It is also
    possible to provide cells values in other formats if appropriate, e.g. as
    numbers.

    This base class is not quite abstract as it implements a trivial strategy
    for storing the attributes by forwarding it to wxGridCellAttrProvider and

/**
    @class wxGrid

    wxGrid and its related classes are used for displaying and editing tabular
    data. They provide a rich set of features for display, editing, and
    interacting with a variety of data sources. For simple applications, and to
    help you get started, wxGrid is the only class you need to refer to
    directly. It will set up default instances of the other classes and manage
    them for you. For more complex applications you can derive your own classes
    for custom grid views, grid data tables, cell editors and renderers. The
    @ref overview_grid has examples of simple and more complex applications,
    explains the relationship between the various grid classes and has a
    summary of the keyboard shortcuts and mouse functions provided by wxGrid.

    A wxGridTableBase class holds the actual data to be displayed by a wxGrid
    class. One or more wxGrid classes may act as a view for one table class.
    The default table class is called wxGridStringTable and holds an array of
    strings. An instance of such a class is created by CreateGrid().

    wxGridCellRenderer is the abstract base class for rendering contents in a
    cell. The following renderers are predefined:

    - wxGridCellBoolRenderer
    - wxGridCellFloatRenderer
    - wxGridCellNumberRenderer
    - wxGridCellStringRenderer

    The look of a cell can be further defined using wxGridCellAttr. An object
    of this type may be returned by wxGridTableBase::GetAttr().

    wxGridCellEditor is the abstract base class for editing the value of a
    cell. The following editors are predefined:

    - wxGridCellBoolEditor
    - wxGridCellChoiceEditor
    - wxGridCellFloatEditor
    - wxGridCellNumberEditor
    - wxGridCellTextEditor

    Please see wxGridEvent, wxGridSizeEvent, wxGridRangeSelectEvent, and
    wxGridEditorCreatedEvent for the documentation of all event types you can
    use with wxGrid.

        code itself. This has the advantage of making the grid look and feel
        perfectly the same as native applications (using SetUseNativeColLabels()
        the grid can be made to look more natively but it still doesn't feel
        natively, notably the column resizing and dragging still works slightly
        differently as it is implemented in wxWidgets itself) but results in
        different behaviour for column and row headers, for which there is no
        equivalent function, and, most importantly, is unsuitable for grids
        with huge numbers of columns as wxHeaderCtrl doesn't support virtual
        mode. Because of this, by default the grid does not use the native
        header control but you should call this function to enable it if you
        are using the grid to display tabular data and don't have thousands of
        columns in it.

        Another difference between the default behaviour and the native header
        behaviour is that the latter provides the user with a context menu
        (which appears on right clicking the header) allowing to rearrange the
        grid columns if CanDragColMove() returns @true. If you want to prevent
        this from happening for some reason, you need to define a handler for
        @c wxEVT_GRID_LABEL_RIGHT_CLICK event which simply does nothing (in
        particular doesn't skip the event) as this will prevent the default
        right click handling from working.

        Also note that currently @c wxEVT_GRID_LABEL_RIGHT_DCLICK event is not
        generated for the column labels if the native columns header is used
        (but this limitation could possibly be lifted in the future).

        However if a custom table returns @c wxGRID_VALUE_BOOL from its
        wxGridTableBase::GetTypeName() method, then wxGridCellBoolRenderer and
        wxGridCellBoolEditor are used for it because the grid also registers a
        boolean data type with this name.

        And as this mechanism is completely generic, you may register your own
        data types using your own custom renderers and editors. Just remember
        that the table must identify a cell as being of the given type for them
        to be used for this cell.

        @param typeName
            Name of the new type. May be any string, but if the type name is
            the same as the name of an already registered type, including one
            of the standard ones (which are @c wxGRID_VALUE_STRING, @c
            wxGRID_VALUE_BOOL, @c wxGRID_VALUE_NUMBER, @c wxGRID_VALUE_FLOAT
            and @c wxGRID_VALUE_CHOICE), then the new registration information
            replaces the previously used renderer and editor.
        @param renderer
            The renderer to use for the cells of this type. Its ownership is
            taken by the grid, i.e. it will call DecRef() on this pointer when
            it doesn't need it any longer.
        @param editor

    This small class can be used to prevent wxGrid from redrawing during its

    performing several operations with a grid which would otherwise result in
    flicker. For example:

    @code

        m_grid-AppendRow();

        // destructor called, grid refreshed
    }
    @endcode

    @class wxGridEvent

    This event class contains information about various grid events.

    Notice that all grid event table macros are available in two versions:
    @c EVT_GRID_XXX and @c EVT_GRID_CMD_XXX. The only difference between the
    two is that the former doesn't allow to specify the grid window identifier
    and so takes a single parameter, the event handler, but is not suitable if
    there is more than one grid control in the window where the event table is
    used (as it would catch the events from all the grids). The version with @c
    CMD takes the id as first argument and the event handler as the second one
    and so can be used with multiple grids as well. Otherwise there are no
    difference between the two and only the versions without the id are
    documented below for brevity.

    @beginEventTable{wxGridEvent}
    @event{EVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGING(func)}
        The user is about to change the data in a cell. The new cell value as
        string is available from GetString() event object method. This event
        can be vetoed if the change is not allowed.
        Processes a @c wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGING event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGED(func)}
        The user changed the data in a cell. The old cell value as string is
        available from GetString() event object method. Notice that vetoing
        this event still works for backwards compatibility reasons but any new
        code should only veto EVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGING event and not this one.
        Processes a @c wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGED event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_CELL_LEFT_CLICK(func)}
        The user clicked a cell with the left mouse button. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_CELL_LEFT_CLICK event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_CELL_LEFT_DCLICK(func)}
        The user double-clicked a cell with the left mouse button. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_CELL_LEFT_DCLICK event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_CELL_RIGHT_CLICK(func)}
        The user clicked a cell with the right mouse button. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_CELL_RIGHT_CLICK event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_CELL_RIGHT_DCLICK(func)}
        The user double-clicked a cell with the right mouse button. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_CELL_RIGHT_DCLICK event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_EDITOR_HIDDEN(func)}
        The editor for a cell was hidden. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_EDITOR_HIDDEN event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_EDITOR_SHOWN(func)}
        The editor for a cell was shown. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_EDITOR_SHOWN event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_LABEL_LEFT_CLICK(func)}
        The user clicked a label with the left mouse button. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_LABEL_LEFT_CLICK event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_LABEL_LEFT_DCLICK(func)}
        The user double-clicked a label with the left mouse button. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_LABEL_LEFT_DCLICK event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_LABEL_RIGHT_CLICK(func)}
        The user clicked a label with the right mouse button. Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_LABEL_RIGHT_CLICK event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_LABEL_RIGHT_DCLICK(func)}
        The user double-clicked a label with the right mouse button. Processes
        a @c wxEVT_GRID_LABEL_RIGHT_DCLICK event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_SELECT_CELL(func)}
        The given cell was made current, either by user or by the program via a
        call to SetGridCursor() or GoToCell(). Processes a
        @c wxEVT_GRID_SELECT_CELL event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_COL_MOVE(func)}
        The user tries to change the order of the columns in the grid by
        dragging the column specified by GetCol(). This event can be vetoed to
        either prevent the user from reordering the column change completely
        (but notice that if you don't want to allow it at all, you simply
        shouldn't call wxGrid::EnableDragColMove() in the first place), vetoed
        but handled in some way in the handler, e.g. by really moving the
        column to the new position at the associated table level, or allowed to
        proceed in which case wxGrid::SetColPos() is used to reorder the
        columns display order without affecting the use of the column indices
        otherwise.
        This event macro corresponds to @c wxEVT_GRID_COL_MOVE event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_COL_SORT(func)}
        This event is generated when a column is clicked by the user and its
        name is explained by the fact that the custom reaction to a click on a
        column is to sort the grid contents by this column. However the grid
        itself has no special support for sorting and it's up to the handler of
        this event to update the associated table. But if the event is handled
        (and not vetoed) the grid supposes that the table was indeed resorted
        and updates the column to indicate the new sort order and refreshes
        itself.
        This event macro corresponds to @c wxEVT_GRID_COL_SORT event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_TABBING(func)}
        This event is generated when the user presses TAB or Shift-TAB in the
        grid. It can be used to customize the simple default TAB handling
        logic, e.g. to go to the next non-empty cell instead of just the next
        cell. See also wxGrid::SetTabBehaviour(). This event is new since
        wxWidgets 2.9.5.

    @class wxGridSizeEvent

    This event class contains information about a row/column resize event.

    @beginEventTable{wxGridSizeEvent}
    @event{EVT_GRID_CMD_COL_SIZE(id, func)}
        The user resized a column, corresponds to @c wxEVT_GRID_COL_SIZE event
        type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_CMD_ROW_SIZE(id, func)}
        The user resized a row, corresponds to @c wxEVT_GRID_ROW_SIZE event
        type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_COL_SIZE(func)}
        Same as EVT_GRID_CMD_COL_SIZE() but uses `wxID_ANY` id.
    @event{EVT_GRID_COL_AUTO_SIZE(func)}
        This event is sent when a column must be resized to its best size, e.g.
        when the user double clicks the column divider. The default
        implementation simply resizes the column to fit the column label (but
        not its contents as this could be too slow for big grids). This macro
        corresponds to @c wxEVT_GRID_COL_AUTO_SIZE event type and is new since
        wxWidgets 2.9.5.
    @event{EVT_GRID_ROW_SIZE(func)}
        Same as EVT_GRID_CMD_ROW_SIZE() but uses `wxID_ANY` id.
