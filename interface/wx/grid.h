/**
    Class providing attributes to be used for the grid cells.

    This class both defines an interface which grid cell attributes providers
    should implement -- and which can be implemented differently in derived
    classes -- and a default implementation of this interface which is often
    good enough to be used without modification, especially with not very large
    grids for which the efficiency of attributes storage hardly matters (see
    the discussion below).

    An object of this class can be associated with a wxGrid using
    wxGridTableBase::SetAttrProvider() but it's not necessary to call it if you
    intend to use the default provider as it is used by wxGridTableBase by
    default anyhow.

    Notice that while attributes provided by this class can be set for
    individual cells using SetAttr() or the entire rows or columns using
    SetRowAttr() and SetColAttr() they are always retrieved using GetAttr()
    function.


    The default implementation of this class stores the attributes passed to
    its SetAttr(), SetRowAttr() and SetColAttr() in a straightforward way. A
    derived class may use its knowledge about how the attributes are used in
    your program to implement it much more efficiently: for example, using a
    special background colour for all even-numbered rows can be implemented by
    simply returning the same attribute from GetAttr() if the row number is
    even instead of having to store N/2 row attributes where N is the total
    number of rows in the grid.

    Notice that objects of this class can't be copied.

    @class wxGridTableBase

    The almost abstract base class for grid tables.

    A grid table is responsible for storing the grid data and, indirectly, grid
    cell attributes. The data can be stored in the way most convenient for the
    application but has to be provided in string form to wxGrid. It is also
    possible to provide cells values in other formats if appropriate, e.g. as
    numbers.

    This base class is not quite abstract as it implements a trivial strategy
    for storing the attributes by forwarding it to wxGridCellAttrProvider and
    also provides stubs for some other functions. However it does have a number
    of pure virtual methods which must be implemented in the derived classes.

/**
    @class wxGrid

    wxGrid and its related classes are used for displaying and editing tabular
    data. They provide a rich set of features for display, editing, and
    interacting with a variety of data sources. For simple applications, and to
    help you get started, wxGrid is the only class you need to refer to
    directly. It will set up default instances of the other classes and manage
    them for you. For more complex applications you can derive your own classes
    for custom grid views, grid data tables, cell editors and renderers. The
    @ref overview_grid has examples of simple and more complex applications,
    explains the relationship between the various grid classes and has a
    summary of the keyboard shortcuts and mouse functions provided by wxGrid.

    A wxGridTableBase class holds the actual data to be displayed by a wxGrid
    class. One or more wxGrid classes may act as a view for one table class.
    The default table class is called wxGridStringTable and holds an array of
    strings. An instance of such a class is created by CreateGrid().

    wxGridCellRenderer is the abstract base class for rendering contents in a
    cell. The following renderers are predefined:

    - wxGridCellBoolRenderer
    - wxGridCellFloatRenderer
    - wxGridCellNumberRenderer
    - wxGridCellStringRenderer
    - wxGridCellDateRenderer
    - wxGridCellDateTimeRenderer

    The look of a cell can be further defined using wxGridCellAttr. An object
    of this type may be returned by wxGridTableBase::GetAttr().

    wxGridCellEditor is the abstract base class for editing the value of a
    cell. The following editors are predefined:

    - wxGridCellBoolEditor
    - wxGridCellChoiceEditor
    - wxGridCellFloatEditor
    - wxGridCellNumberEditor
    - wxGridCellTextEditor
    - wxGridCellDateEditor

        If this function is called with @true argument, a wxHeaderCtrl is used
        instead to display the column labels instead of drawing them in wxGrid
        code itself. This has the advantage of making the grid look and feel
        perfectly the same as native applications (using SetUseNativeColLabels()
        the grid can be made to look more natively but it still doesn't feel
        natively, notably the column resizing and dragging still works slightly
        differently as it is implemented in wxWidgets itself) but results in
        different behaviour for column and row headers, for which there is no
        equivalent function, and, most importantly, is unsuitable for grids
        with huge numbers of columns as wxHeaderCtrl doesn't support virtual
        mode. Because of this, by default the grid does not use the native
        header control but you should call this function to enable it if you
        are using the grid to display tabular data and don't have thousands of
        columns in it.

        Another difference between the default behaviour and the native header
        behaviour is that the latter provides the user with a context menu
        (which appears on right clicking the header) allowing to rearrange the
        grid columns if CanDragColMove() returns @true. If you want to prevent
        this from happening for some reason, you need to define a handler for
        @c wxEVT_GRID_LABEL_RIGHT_CLICK event which simply does nothing (in
        particular doesn't skip the event) as this will prevent the default
        right click handling from working.

        Also note that currently @c wxEVT_GRID_LABEL_RIGHT_DCLICK event is not
        generated for the column labels if the native columns header is used
        (but this limitation could possibly be lifted in the future).

        Finally, please note that using the native control is currently
        incompatible with freezing columns in the grid (see FreezeTo()) and
        this function will return @false, without doing anything, if it's
        called on a grid in which any columns are frozen.

        The data types allow to naturally associate specific renderers and

        @c wxGRID_VALUE_STRING which uses wxGridCellStringRenderer and
        wxGridCellTextEditor as its renderer and editor respectively -- this is
        the data type used by all the cells of the default wxGridStringTable,

        However if a custom table returns @c wxGRID_VALUE_BOOL from its
        wxGridTableBase::GetTypeName() method, then wxGridCellBoolRenderer and
        wxGridCellBoolEditor are used for it because the grid also registers a
        boolean data type with this name.

        data types using your own custom renderers and editors. Just remember
        that the table must identify a cell as being of the given type for them
        to be used for this cell.

            registration information replaces the previously used renderer and

        @param renderer

    This small class can be used to prevent wxGrid from redrawing during its

    wxGrid::EndBatch() in its destructor. It is typically used in a function
    performing several operations with a grid which would otherwise result in
    flicker. For example:

    @code

        // destructor called, grid refreshed
    }
    @endcode

        but handled in some way in the handler, e.g. by really moving the
        column to the new position at the associated table level, or allowed to
        proceed in which case wxGrid::SetColPos() is used to reorder the
        columns display order without affecting the use of the column indices
        otherwise.
        This event macro corresponds to @c wxEVT_GRID_COL_MOVE event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_COL_SORT(func)}
        This event is generated when a column is clicked by the user and its
        name is explained by the fact that the custom reaction to a click on a
        column is to sort the grid contents by this column. However the grid
        itself has no special support for sorting and it's up to the handler of
        this event to update the associated table. But if the event is handled
        (and not vetoed) the grid supposes that the table was indeed resorted
        and updates the column to indicate the new sort order and refreshes
        itself.
        This event macro corresponds to @c wxEVT_GRID_COL_SORT event type.
    @event{EVT_GRID_TABBING(func)}
        This event is generated when the user presses TAB or Shift-TAB in the
        grid. It can be used to customize the simple default TAB handling
        logic, e.g. to go to the next non-empty cell instead of just the next
        cell. See also wxGrid::SetTabBehaviour(). This event is new since
        wxWidgets 2.9.5.

/**
    @class wxGridRangeSelectEvent

    Events of this class notify about a range of cells being selected.

    When the user uses the mouse for selection, one or more @c SELECTING events
    are generated first, with @c SELECTED event generated at the end, when
    selection is final. This allows the application to handle either the @c
    SELECTING events if it needs to update its state in real-time, as the
    selection changes, or just the final @c SELECTED event, if updating its
    state on every selection change would be too time-consuming.

    Note that if the user performs the selection from keyboard, @c SELECTING
    events are not generated at all, so @c SELECTED event still must be
    handled.

    Finally, contrary to most of the other events with the name ending in
    "ing", @c SELECTING event can @e not be vetoed.
