    @class wxPanel

    A panel is a window on which controls are placed. It is usually placed within
    a frame. Its main feature over its parent class wxWindow is code for handling
    child windows and TAB traversal. Since wxWidgets 2.9, there is support both
    for TAB traversal implemented by wxWidgets itself as well as native TAB
    traversal (such as for GTK 2.0).

    @note Tab traversal is implemented through an otherwise undocumented
          intermediate wxControlContainer class from which any class can derive
          in addition to the normal wxWindow base class. Please see @c wx/containr.h
          and @c wx/panel.h to find out how this is achieved.

    @note if not all characters are being intercepted by your OnKeyDown or
          OnChar handler, it may be because you are using the @c wxTAB_TRAVERSAL style,
          which grabs some keypresses for use by child controls.

    @remarks By default, a panel has the same colouring as a dialog.

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxNavigationKeyEvent}
    @event{EVT_NAVIGATION_KEY(func)}
        Process a navigation key event.
    @endEventTable

            either the windowing system or wxWidgets, depending on platform.

            The window style. See wxPanel.
