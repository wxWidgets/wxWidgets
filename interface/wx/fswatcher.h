    @class wxFileSystemWatcher

    The wxFileSystemWatcher class allows to receive notifications of file
    system changes.

    @note Implementation limitations: this class is currently implemented for
          MSW, OS X and GTK ports but doesn't detect all changes correctly
          everywhere: under MSW accessing the file is not detected (only
          modifying it is) and under OS X neither accessing nor modifying is
          detected (only creating and deleting files is). Moreover, OS X
          version doesn't currently collapse pairs of create/delete events in a
          rename event, unlike the other ones.

    @note The application's event loop needs to be running before a
          wxFileSystemWatcher can be properly created, and that is why one
          should not be created too early during application startup.
          If you intend to create a wxFileSystemWatcher at startup, you can
          override wxAppConsole::OnEventLoopEnter() to ensure it is not done
          too early.

    For the full list of change types that are reported see wxFSWFlags.

    This class notifies the application about the file system changes by
    sending events of wxFileSystemWatcherEvent class. By default these events
    are sent to the wxFileSystemWatcher object itself so you can derive from it
    and use the event table @c EVT_FSWATCHER macro to handle these events in a
    derived class method. Alternatively, you can use
    wxFileSystemWatcher::SetOwner() to send the events to another object. Or
    you could use wxEvtHandler::Connect() with @c wxEVT_FSWATCHER to handle
    these events in any other object. See the fswatcher sample for an example
    of the latter approach.

        events. Use AddTree() to monitor the directory recursively.

        Note that on platforms that use symbolic links, you should consider the
        possibility that @a path is a symlink. To watch the symlink itself and
        not its target you may call wxFileName::DontFollowLink() on @a path.

        @param path
            The name of the path to watch.

            An optional filter to receive only events of particular types.

        file/directory in the tree rooted at @a path.

        Additionally a file mask can be specified to include only files
        matching that particular mask.

        This method is implemented efficiently on MSW and OS X >= 10.7, but
        should be used with care on other platforms for directories with lots
        of children (e.g. the root directory) as it calls Add() for each
        subdirectory, potentially creating a lot of watches and taking a long
        time to execute.

        Note that on platforms that use symbolic links, you will probably want
        to have called wxFileName::DontFollowLink on @a path. This is especially
        important if the symlink targets may themselves be watched.
