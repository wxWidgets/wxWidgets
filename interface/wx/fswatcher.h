    @class wxFileSystemWatcher

    The wxFileSystemWatcher class allows to receive notifications of file
    system changes.

    @note Implementation limitations: this class is currently implemented for
          MSW, OS X and GTK ports but doesn't detect all changes correctly
          everywhere: under MSW accessing the file is not detected (only
          modifying it is) and under OS X neither accessing nor modifying is
          detected (only creating and deleting files is). Moreover, OS X
          version doesn't currently collapse pairs of create/delete events in a
          rename event, unlike the other ones.

    For the full list of change types that are reported see wxFSWFlags.

    There are three different ways to use this class:

     - You may derive a new class from wxFileSystemWatcher and override the
       wxFileSystemWatcher::OnChange member to perform the required action
       when file system change occurrs. Additionally you may also want to
       override wxFileSystemWatcher::OnWarning and
       wxFileSystemWatcher::OnError to be notified when an error condition
       arises.
     - You may use a derived class and the @c EVT_FSWATCHER macro or
       wxEvtHandler::Connect to redirect events to an event handler defined in
       the derived class. If the default constructor is used, the file system
       watcher object will be its own owner object, since it is derived from
       wxEvtHandler.
     - You may redirect the notifications of file system changes as well as of
       error conditions to any wxEvtHandler derived object by using
       wxFileSystemWatcher::SetOwner.
       Then use the @c EVT_FSWATCHER macro or wxEvtHandler::Connect to send the
       events to the event handler which will receive wxFileSystemWatcherEvent.

    For example:

    @code
    class MyWatcher : public wxFileSystemWatcher
    {
    protected:
        void OnChange(int changeType, const wxFileName& path, const wxFileName& newPath)
        {
            // do whatever you like with the event
        }
    };

    class MyApp : public wxApp
    {
    public:
        ...
        void OnEventLoopEnter(wxEventLoopBase* WXUNUSED(loop))
        {
            // you have to construct the watcher here, because it needs an active loop
            m_watcher = new MyWatcher();

            // please notify me when a new log file is created
            m_watcher->Add(wxFileName::DirName("/var/log", wxFSW_EVENT_CREATE);
        }

    private:
        MyWatcher* m_watcher;
    };
