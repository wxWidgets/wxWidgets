    @class wxHelpController

    This is a family of classes by which applications may invoke a help viewer
    to provide on-line help.

    A help controller allows an application to display help, at the contents
    or at a particular topic, and shut the help program down on termination.
    This avoids proliferation of many instances of the help viewer whenever the
    user requests a different topic via the application's menus or buttons.

    Typically, an application will create a help controller instance when it starts,
    and immediately call wxHelpController::Initialize to associate a filename with it.
    The help viewer will only get run, however, just before the first call to
    display something.

    Most help controller classes actually derive from wxHelpControllerBase and have
    names of the form wxXXXHelpController or wxHelpControllerXXX.
    An appropriate class is aliased to the name wxHelpController for each platform, as
    follows:
    - On desktop Windows, wxCHMHelpController is used (MS HTML Help).
    - On Windows CE, wxWinceHelpController is used.
    - On all other platforms, wxHtmlHelpController is used if wxHTML is compiled
      into wxWidgets; otherwise wxExtHelpController is used (for invoking an
      external browser).

    The remaining help controller classes need to be named explicitly by an
    application that wishes to make use of them.

    The following help controller classes are defined:
    - wxWinHelpController, for controlling Windows Help.
    - wxCHMHelpController, for controlling MS HTML Help. To use this, you need to
      set wxUSE_MS_HTML_HELP to 1 in setup.h and have the htmlhelp.h header from
      Microsoft's HTML Help kit. (You don't need the VC++-specific htmlhelp.lib
      because wxWidgets loads necessary DLL at runtime and so it works with all
      compilers.)
    - wxBestHelpController, for controlling MS HTML Help or, if Microsoft's runtime
      is not available, wxHtmlHelpController. You need to provide @b both CHM and
      HTB versions of the help file. For wxMSW only.
    - wxExtHelpController, for controlling external browsers under Unix.
      The default browser is Netscape Navigator. The 'help' sample shows its use.
    - wxWinceHelpController, for controlling a simple @c .htm help controller for
      Windows CE applications.
    - wxHtmlHelpController, a sophisticated help controller using wxHTML, in a
      similar style to the Microsoft HTML Help viewer and using some of the same
      files. Although it has an API compatible with other help controllers, it has
      more advanced features, so it is recommended that you use the specific API
      for this class instead. Note that if you use .zip or .htb formats for your
      books, you must add this line to your application initialization:
      @code wxFileSystem::AddHandler(new wxArchiveFSHandler); @endcode
      or nothing will be shown in your help window.

        parent for the help window instead of the value of wxApp::GetTopWindow.

        You can also change the parent window later with SetParentWindow().
