    @class wxPropertyGrid

    wxPropertyGrid is a specialized grid for editing properties - in other
    words name = value pairs. List of ready-to-use property classes include
    strings, numbers, flag sets, fonts, colours and many others. It is possible,
    for example, to categorize properties, set up a complete tree-hierarchy,
    add more than two columns, and set arbitrary per-property attributes.

    Please note that most member functions are inherited and as such not
    documented on this page. This means you will probably also want to read
    wxPropertyGridInterface class reference.

    See @ref propgrid_window_styles.

    @section propgrid_event_handling Event Handling

    To process input from a property grid control, use these event handler macros
    to direct input to member functions that take a wxPropertyGridEvent argument.

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxPropertyGridEvent}
    @event{EVT_PG_SELECTED (id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_SELECTED event, generated when a property selection
        has been changed, either by user action or by indirect program
        function. For instance, collapsing a parent property programmatically
        causes any selected child property to become unselected, and may
        therefore cause this event to be generated.
    @event{EVT_PG_CHANGED(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_CHANGED event, generated when property value
        has been changed by the user.
    @event{EVT_PG_CHANGING(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_CHANGING event, generated when property value
        is about to be changed by user. Use wxPropertyGridEvent::GetValue()
        to take a peek at the pending value, and wxPropertyGridEvent::Veto()
        to prevent change from taking place, if necessary.
    @event{EVT_PG_HIGHLIGHTED(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_HIGHLIGHTED event, which occurs when mouse
        moves over a property. Event's property is NULL if hovered area does
        not belong to any property.
    @event{EVT_PG_RIGHT_CLICK(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_RIGHT_CLICK event, which occurs when property is
        clicked on with right mouse button.
    @event{EVT_PG_DOUBLE_CLICK(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_DOUBLE_CLICK event, which occurs when property is
        double-clicked on with left mouse button.
    @event{EVT_PG_ITEM_COLLAPSED(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_ITEM_COLLAPSED event, generated when user collapses
        a property or category.
    @event{EVT_PG_ITEM_EXPANDED(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_ITEM_EXPANDED event, generated when user expands
        a property or category.
    @event{EVT_PG_LABEL_EDIT_BEGIN(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_LABEL_EDIT_BEGIN event, generated when user is
        about to begin editing a property label. You can veto this event to
        prevent the action.
    @event{EVT_PG_LABEL_EDIT_ENDING(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_LABEL_EDIT_ENDING event, generated when user is
        about to end editing of a property label. You can veto this event to
        prevent the action.
    @event{EVT_PG_COL_BEGIN_DRAG(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_COL_BEGIN_DRAG event, generated when user
        starts resizing a column - can be vetoed.
    @event{EVT_PG_COL_DRAGGING,(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_COL_DRAGGING, event, generated when a
        column resize by user is in progress. This event is also generated
        when user double-clicks the splitter in order to recenter
        it.
    @event{EVT_PG_COL_END_DRAG(id, func)}
        Respond to @c wxEVT_PG_COL_END_DRAG event, generated after column
        resize by user has finished.
    @endEventTable

    @remarks
    Use Freeze() and Thaw() respectively to disable and enable drawing.
    This will also delay sorting etc. miscellaneous calculations to the last
    possible moment.
