/**
    @class wxPGProperty

    wxPGProperty is base class for all wxPropertyGrid properties. In
    sections below we cover few related topics.

    @li @ref pgproperty_properties
    @li @ref pgproperty_creating

    @section pgproperty_properties Supplied Ready-to-use Property Classes

    Here is a list and short description of supplied fully-functional
    property classes. They are located in either props.h or advprops.h.

    @li @ref wxArrayStringProperty
    @li @ref wxBoolProperty
    @li @ref wxColourProperty
    @li @ref wxCursorProperty
    @li @ref wxDateProperty
    @li @ref wxDirProperty

    @li @ref wxMultiChoiceProperty
    @li @ref wxPropertyCategory
    @li @ref wxStringProperty
    @li @ref wxSystemColourProperty
    @li @ref wxUIntProperty

    @subsection wxPropertyCategory

    Not an actual property per se, but a header for a group of properties.
    Regardless inherits from wxPGProperty, and supports displaying 'labels'
    for columns other than the first one. Easiest way to set category's
    label for second column is to call wxPGProperty::SetValue() with string
    argument.

    @subsection wxStringProperty

    Simple string property. wxPG_STRING_PASSWORD attribute may be used
    to echo value as asterisks and use wxTE_PASSWORD for wxTextCtrl.
    wxPG_ATTR_AUTOCOMPLETE attribute may be used to enable auto-completion
    (use a wxArrayString value), and is also supported by any property that
    happens to use a wxTextCtrl-based editor.

    @remarks wxStringProperty has a special trait: if it has value of
            "<composed>", and also has child properties, then its displayed
            value becomes composition of child property values, similar as
            with wxFontProperty, for instance.

    @subsection wxIntProperty

    Like wxStringProperty, but converts text to a signed long integer.
    wxIntProperty seamlessly supports 64-bit integers (ie. wxLongLong).
    To safely convert variant to integer, use code like this:

    @code
        wxLongLong ll;
        ll << property->GetValue();

        // or
        wxLongLong ll = propertyGrid->GetPropertyValueAsLong(property);
    @endcode

    @subsection wxUIntProperty

    Like wxIntProperty, but displays value as unsigned int. To set
    the prefix used globally, manipulate wxPG_UINT_PREFIX string attribute.
    To set the globally used base, manipulate wxPG_UINT_BASE int
    attribute. Regardless of current prefix, understands (hex) values starting
    with both "0x" and "$".
    Like wxIntProperty, wxUIntProperty seamlessly supports 64-bit unsigned
    integers (ie. wxULongLong). Same wxVariant safety rules apply.

    @subsection wxFloatProperty

    Like wxStringProperty, but converts text to a double-precision floating point.
    Default float-to-text precision is 6 decimals, but this can be changed
    by modifying wxPG_FLOAT_PRECISION attribute.

    Note that when displaying the value, sign is omitted if the resulting
    textual representation is effectively zero (for example, -0.0001 with
    precision of 3 will become 0.0 instead of -0.0). This behaviour is unlike 
    what C standard library does, but should result in better end-user
    experience in almost all cases.

    @subsection wxBoolProperty

    Represents a boolean value. wxChoice is used as editor control, by the
<<<<<<< .mine
    default. wxPG_BOOL_USE_CHECKBOX attribute can be set to true in order to
    use check box instead.
=======
    default. wxPG_BOOL_USE_CHECKBOX attribute can be set to true in order to use
    check box instead.
>>>>>>> .r67279

    @subsection wxLongStringProperty

    Like wxStringProperty, but has a button that triggers a small text editor
    dialog. Note that in long string values, tabs are represented by "\t" and
    line break by "\n".

    To display custom dialog on button press, you can subclass
    wxLongStringProperty and implement OnButtonClick, like this:

    @code
        virtual bool OnButtonClick( wxPropertyGrid* propGrid, wxString& value )
        {
            wxSize dialogSize(...size of your dialog...);

            wxPoint dlgPos = propGrid->GetGoodEditorDialogPosition(this,
                                                                   dialogSize)

            // Create dialog dlg at dlgPos. Use value as initial string
            // value.
            ...

            if ( dlg.ShowModal() == wxID_OK )
            {
                value = dlg.GetStringValue);
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
    @endcode

    Also, if you wish not to have line breaks and tabs translated to
    escape sequences, then do following in constructor of your subclass:

    @code
        m_flags |= wxPG_PROP_NO_ESCAPE;
    @endcode

    @subsection wxDirProperty

    Like wxLongStringProperty, but the button triggers dir selector instead.
    Supported properties (all with string value): wxPG_DIR_DIALOG_MESSAGE.

    @subsection wxFileProperty

    Like wxLongStringProperty, but the button triggers file selector instead.
    Default wildcard is "All files..." but this can be changed by setting
    wxPG_FILE_WILDCARD attribute (see wxFileDialog for format details).
    Attribute wxPG_FILE_SHOW_FULL_PATH can be set to @false in order to show
    only the filename, not the entire path.

    @subsection wxEnumProperty

    Represents a single selection from a list of choices -
    wxOwnerDrawnComboBox is used to edit the value.

    @subsection wxFlagsProperty

    Represents a bit set that fits in a long integer. wxBoolProperty sub-
    properties are created for editing individual bits. Textctrl is created to
    manually edit the flags as a text; a continuous sequence of spaces, commas
    and semicolons are considered as a flag id separator.

    <b>Note:</b> When changing "choices" (ie. flag labels) of wxFlagsProperty,
    you will need to use wxPGProperty::SetChoices() - otherwise they will not
    get updated properly.

    wxFlagsProperty supports the same attributes as wxBoolProperty.

    @subsection wxArrayStringProperty

    Allows editing of a list of strings in wxTextCtrl and in a separate
    dialog. Supports "Delimiter" attribute, which defaults to comma (',').

    @subsection wxDateProperty

    wxDateTime property. Default editor is DatePickerCtrl, although TextCtrl
    should work as well. wxPG_DATE_FORMAT attribute can be used to change
    string wxDateTime::Format uses (although default is recommended as it is
    locale-dependant), and wxPG_DATE_PICKER_STYLE allows changing window
    style given to DatePickerCtrl (default is wxDP_DEFAULT|wxDP_SHOWCENTURY).
    Using wxDP_ALLOWNONE will enable better unspecified value support.

    @subsection wxEditEnumProperty

    Represents a string that can be freely edited or selected from list of choices -
    custom combobox control is used to edit the value.

    @subsection wxMultiChoiceProperty

    Allows editing a multiple selection from a list of strings. This is
    property is pretty much built around concept of wxMultiChoiceDialog.
    It uses wxArrayString value.

    @subsection wxImageFileProperty

    Like wxFileProperty, but has thumbnail of the image in front of
    the filename and autogenerates wildcard from available image handlers.

    @subsection wxColourProperty

    <b>Useful alternate editor:</b> Choice.

    Represents wxColour. wxButton is used to trigger a colour picker dialog.
    There are various sub-classing opportunities with this class. See
    below in wxSystemColourProperty section for details.

    Setting "HasAlpha" attribute to @true for this property allows user to
    edit the alpha colour component.

    @subsection wxFontProperty

    Represents wxFont. Various sub-properties are used to edit individual
    subvalues.

    @subsection wxSystemColourProperty

    Represents wxColour and a system colour index. wxChoice is used to edit
    the value. Drop-down list has color images. Note that value type
    is wxColourPropertyValue instead of wxColour (which wxColourProperty
    uses).

    @code
        class wxColourPropertyValue : public wxObject
        {
        public:
            //  An integer value relating to the colour, and which exact
            //  meaning depends on the property with which it is used.
            //
            //  For wxSystemColourProperty:
            //  Any of wxSYS_COLOUR_XXX, or any web-colour ( use wxPG_TO_WEB_COLOUR
            //  macro - (currently unsupported) ), or wxPG_COLOUR_CUSTOM.
            wxUint32    m_type;

            // Resulting colour. Should be correct regardless of type.
            wxColour    m_colour;
        };
    @endcode

    in wxSystemColourProperty, and its derived class wxColourProperty, there
    are various sub-classing features. To set a basic list of colour
    names, call wxPGProperty::SetChoices().

    @code
        // Override in derived class to customize how colours are translated
        // to strings.
        virtual wxString ColourToString( const wxColour& col, int index ) const;

        // Returns index of entry that triggers colour picker dialog
        // (default is last).
        virtual int GetCustomColourIndex() const;

        // Helper function to show the colour dialog
        bool QueryColourFromUser( wxVariant& variant ) const;

        // Returns colour for given choice.
        // Default function returns wxSystemSettings::GetColour(index).
        virtual wxColour GetColour( int index ) const;
    @endcode

    @subsection wxCursorProperty

    Represents a wxCursor. wxChoice is used to edit the value.
    Drop-down list has cursor images under some (wxMSW) platforms.


    @section pgproperty_creating Creating Custom Properties

    New properties can be created by subclassing wxPGProperty or one
    of the provided property classes, and (re)implementing necessary
    member functions. Below, each virtual member function has ample
    documentation about its purpose and any odd details which to keep
    in mind.

    Here is a very simple 'template' code:

    @code
        class MyProperty : public wxPGProperty
        {
        public:
            // Default constructor
            MyProperty() { }

            // All arguments of this ctor must have a default value -
            // use wxPG_LABEL for label and name
            MyProperty( const wxString& label = wxPG_LABEL,
                        const wxString& name = wxPG_LABEL,
                        const wxString& value = wxEmptyString )
                : wxPGProperty(label, name)
            {
                // m_value is wxVariant
                m_value = value;
            }

            virtual ~MyProperty() { }

            const wxPGEditor* DoGetEditorClass() const
            {
                // Determines editor used by property.
                // You can replace 'TextCtrl' below with any of these
                // builtin-in property editor identifiers: Choice, ComboBox,
                // TextCtrlAndButton, ChoiceAndButton, CheckBox, SpinCtrl,
                // DatePickerCtrl.
                return wxPGEditor_TextCtrl;
            }

            virtual wxString ValueToString( wxVariant& value,
                                            int argFlags ) const
            {
                // TODO: Convert given property value to a string
            }

            virtual bool StringToValue( wxVariant& variant, const wxString& text, int argFlags )
            {
                // TODO: Adapt string to property value.
            }

        protected:
        };
    @endcode

    Since wxPGProperty derives from wxObject, you can use standard
    wxDECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLASS and wxIMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC_CLASS macros. From the
    above example they were omitted for sake of simplicity, and besides,
    they are only really needed if you need to use wxRTTI with your
    property class.

    You can change the 'value type' of a property by simply assigning different
    type of variant with SetValue. <b>It is mandatory to implement
    wxVariantData class for all data types used as property values.</b>
    You can use macros declared in wxPropertyGrid headers. For instance:

    @code
        // In header file:
        // (If you need to have export declaration, use version of macros
        // with _EXPORTED postfix)
        WX_PG_DECLARE_VARIANT_DATA(MyDataClass)

        // In sources file:
        WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_VARIANT_DATA(MyDataClass)

        // Or, if you don't have valid == operator:
        WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_VARIANT_DATA_DUMMY_EQ(MyDataClass)
    @endcode

        Override to paint an image in front of the property value text or drop-down

        If property's OnMeasureImage() returns size that has height != 0 but less than
        row height ( < 0 has special meanings), wxPropertyGrid calls this method to
        draw a custom image in a limited area in front of the editor control or
        value text/graphics, and if control has drop-down list, then the image is
        drawn there as well (even in the case OnMeasureImage() returned higher height
        than row height).

        NOTE: Following applies when OnMeasureImage() returns a "flexible" height (
        using wxPG_FLEXIBLE_SIZE(W,H) macro), which implies variable height items:
        If rect.x is < 0, then this is a measure item call, which means that
        dc is invalid and only thing that should be done is to set paintdata.m_drawnHeight
        to the height of the image of item at index paintdata.m_choiceItem. This call
        may be done even as often as once every drop-down popup show.

        @param dc

        @param rect
        Box reserved for custom graphics. Includes surrounding rectangle, if any.
        If x is < 0, then this is a measure item call (see above).
        @param paintdata
        wxPGPaintData structure with much useful data about painted item.
        @code
        struct wxPGPaintData
        {

            - Due to technical reasons, rect's height will be default even if custom height
              was reported during measure call.
            - Brush is guaranteed to be default background colour. It has been already used to
              clear the background of area being painted. It can be modified.
