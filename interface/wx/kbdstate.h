/**
    Provides methods for testing the state of the keyboard modifier keys.

    This class is used as a base class of wxKeyEvent and wxMouseState and,
    hence, indirectly, of wxMouseEvent, so its methods may be used to get
    information about the modifier keys which were pressed when the event
    occurred.

    This class is implemented entirely inline in @<wx/kbdstate.h@> and thus has
    no linking requirements.

class wxKeyboardState
{
public:
    /**
        Constructor initializes the modifier key settings.

        By default, no modifiers are active.
     */
    wxKeyboardState(bool controlDown = false,
                    bool shiftDown = false,
                    bool altDown = false,
                    bool metaDown = false);

    /**
        Return the bit mask of all pressed modifier keys.

        The return value is a combination of @c wxMOD_ALT, @c wxMOD_CONTROL,
        @c wxMOD_SHIFT and @c wxMOD_META bit masks. Additionally, @c wxMOD_NONE
        is defined as 0, i.e. corresponds to no modifiers (see HasAnyModifiers())
        and @c wxMOD_CMD is either @c wxMOD_CONTROL (MSW and Unix) or
        @c wxMOD_META (Mac), see CmdDown().
        See ::wxKeyModifier for the full list of modifiers.

        Notice that this function is easier to use correctly than, for example,
        ControlDown() because when using the latter you also have to remember to
        test that none of the other modifiers is pressed:

        @code
        if ( ControlDown() && !AltDown() && !ShiftDown() && !MetaDown() )
            ... handle Ctrl-XXX ...
        @endcode

        and forgetting to do it can result in serious program bugs (e.g. program
        not working with European keyboard layout where @c AltGr key which is
        seen by the program as combination of CTRL and ALT is used). On the
        other hand, you can simply write:

        @code
        if ( GetModifiers() == wxMOD_CONTROL )
            ... handle Ctrl-XXX ...
        @endcode

        with this function.

        This is equivalent to @c GetModifiers() @c != @c wxMOD_NONE.

        Notice that this is different from HasModifiers() method which doesn't
        take e.g. Shift modifier into account. This method is most suitable for
        mouse events when any modifier, including Shift, can change the
        interpretation of the event.

        reasons and also because pressing Shift usually doesn't change the
