    @class wxProcess

    The objects of this class are used in conjunction with the ::wxExecute() function.
    When a wxProcess object is passed to ::wxExecute(), its OnTerminate() virtual method
    is called when the process terminates. This allows the program to be (asynchronously)
    notified about the process termination and also retrieve its exit status which is
    unavailable from ::wxExecute() in the case of asynchronous execution.

    @note
        If the @c wxEVT_END_PROCESS event sent after termination is processed by the
        parent, then it is responsible for deleting the wxProcess object which sent it.
        However, if it is not processed, the object will <b>delete itself</b> and so the
        library users should only delete those objects whose notifications have been
        processed (and call wxProcess::Detach for others).
        This also means that unless you're going to process the @c wxEVT_END_PROCESS event,
        you <b>must</b> allocate the wxProcess class on the heap.

    wxProcess also supports IO redirection of the child process. For this, you have
    to call its Redirect() method before passing it to ::wxExecute().
    If the child process was launched successfully, GetInputStream(), GetOutputStream()
    and GetErrorStream() can then be used to retrieve the streams corresponding to the
    child process standard output, input and error output respectively.

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxProcessEvent}
    @event{EVT_END_PROCESS(id, func)}
        Process a @c wxEVT_END_PROCESS event, sent by wxProcess::OnTerminate upon
        the external process termination.

        is closed by the user) and in this case it @b should not delete the wxProcess
