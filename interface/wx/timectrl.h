    @class wxTimePickerCtrl

    This control allows the user to enter time.

    It is similar to wxDatePickerCtrl but is used for time, and not date,
    selection. While GetValue() and SetValue() still work with values of type
    wxDateTime (because wxWidgets doesn't provide a time-only class), their
    date part is ignored by this control.

    It is only available if @c wxUSE_TIMEPICKCTRL is set to 1.

    This control currently doesn't have any specific flags.

    @beginEventEmissionTable{wxDateEvent}
    @event{EVT_TIME_CHANGED(id, func)}
           This event fires when the user changes the current selection in the
           control.

            Initial size. If left at default value, the control chooses its own
            best size by using the height approximately equal to a text control
            and width large enough to show the time fully.
        @param style
            The window style, should be left at 0 as there are no special

        In particular, notice that it is a bad idea to use default wxDateTime
        constructor from hour, minute and second values as it uses the today
        date for the date part, which means that some values can be invalid if
        today happens to be the day of DST change. For example, when switching
        to summer time, the time 2:00 typically doesn't exist as the clocks jump
        directly to 3:00. To avoid this problem, use a fixed date on which DST
        is known not to change (e.g. Jan 1, 2012) for the date part of the
        argument or use SetTime().
