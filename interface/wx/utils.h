    Executes another program in Unix or Windows.

    In the overloaded versions of this function, if @a flags parameter contains
    @c wxEXEC_ASYNC flag (the default), flow of control immediately returns. If
    it contains @c wxEXEC_SYNC, the current application waits until the other
    program has terminated.

    In the case of synchronous execution, the return value is the exit code of
    the process (which terminates by the moment the function returns) and will
    be -1 if the process couldn't be started and typically 0 if the process
    terminated successfully. Also, while waiting for the process to terminate,
    wxExecute() will call wxYield(). Because of this, by default this function
    disables all application windows to avoid unexpected reentrancies which
    could result from the users interaction with the program while the child
    process is running. If you are sure that it is safe to not disable the
    program windows, you may pass @c wxEXEC_NODISABLE flag to prevent this
    automatic disabling from happening.

    For asynchronous execution, however, the return value is the process id and
    zero value indicates that the command could not be executed. As an added
    complication, the return value of -1 in this case indicates that we didn't
    launch a new process, but connected to the running one (this can only
    happen when using DDE under Windows for command execution). In particular,
    in this case only, the calling code will not get the notification about
    process termination.

    If @a callback isn't @NULL and if execution is asynchronous,
    wxProcess::OnTerminate() will be called when the process finishes.
    Specifying this parameter also allows you to redirect the standard input
    and/or output of the process being launched by calling
    wxProcess::Redirect().

    Under Windows, when launching a console process its console is shown by
    default but hidden if its IO is redirected. Both of these default
    behaviours may be overridden: if ::wxEXEC_HIDE_CONSOLE is specified, the
    console will never be shown. If ::wxEXEC_SHOW_CONSOLE is used, the console
    will be shown even if the child process IO is redirected. Neither of these
    flags affect non-console Windows applications or does anything under the
    other systems.

    Under Unix the flag @c wxEXEC_MAKE_GROUP_LEADER may be used to ensure that
    the new process is a group leader (this will create a new session if
    needed). Calling wxKill() passing wxKILL_CHILDREN will kill this process as
    well as all of its children (except those which have started their own
    session). Under MSW, this flag can be used with console processes only and
    corresponds to the native @c CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP flag.

    The @c wxEXEC_NOEVENTS flag prevents processing of any events from taking
    place while the child process is running. It should be only used for very
    short-lived processes as otherwise the application windows risk becoming
    unresponsive from the users point of view. As this flag only makes sense
    with @c wxEXEC_SYNC, @c wxEXEC_BLOCK equal to the sum of both of these
    flags is provided as a convenience.

    @note Currently wxExecute() can only be used from the main thread, calling
          this function from another thread will result in an assert failure in
          debug build and won't work.

    @param command

        either case) or wxEXEC_NODISABLE and wxEXEC_NOEVENTS or wxEXEC_BLOCK,
        which is equal to their combination, in wxEXEC_SYNC case.
