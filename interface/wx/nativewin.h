    @class wxNativeWindow

    Allows to embed a native widget in an application using wxWidgets.

    This class can be used as a bridge between wxWidgets and native GUI
    toolkit, i.e. standard Windows controls under MSW, GTK+ widgets or Cocoa
    views. Using it involves writing code specific to each platform, at the
    very least for creating the native window, but possibly also to handle its
    events, but this class takes care of all the generic parts.

    @note Check whether @c wxHAS_NATIVE_WINDOW is defined before using this
        class as it is not available under all platforms.

    For example, to embed a native GTK+ "light switch" control in a wxWidgets
    dialog you could do the following:
    @code
        #include <wx/nativewin.h>

        wxNativeWindow* switch = new wxNativeWindow(parent, wxID_ANY, gtk_switch_new());
    @endcode
    and then use @c switch as usual, e.g. add it to a sizer to layout it
    correctly. Of course, you will still have to use the native GTK+ functions
    to handle its events and change or retrieve its state.

    See the "native" page of the widgets sample for another example of using
    it.

        Use GetHandle() to check if the creation was successful, it will return
        0 if the handle was invalid.

        @param parent A non-NULL parent window. For the platforms where the

            be the wxWindow corresponding to the parent handle used when
            creating the native window.
        @param winid ID for the new window which will be used for the events
            generated by it and can also be used to FindWindowById().
        @param handle A valid native window handle, i.e. HWND under MSW.
        @return @true if the creation was successful or @false if it failed,
            typically because the supplied parameters are invalid.
