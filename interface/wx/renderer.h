    @class wxDelegateRendererNative

    wxDelegateRendererNative allows reuse of renderers code by forwarding all the
    wxRendererNative methods to the given object and
    thus allowing you to only modify some of its methods -- without having to
    reimplement all of them.

    Note that the "normal", inheritance-based approach, doesn't work with the
    renderers as it is impossible to derive from a class unknown at compile-time
    and the renderer is only chosen at run-time. So suppose that you want to only
    add something to the drawing of the tree control buttons but leave all the
    other methods unchanged -- the only way to do it, considering that the renderer
    class which you want to customize might not even be written yet when you write
    your code (it could be written later and loaded from a DLL during run-time), is
    by using this class.

    Except for the constructor, it has exactly the same methods as
    wxRendererNative and their implementation is
    trivial: they are simply forwarded to the real renderer. Note that the "real"
    renderer may, in turn, be a wxDelegateRendererNative as well and that there may
    be arbitrarily many levels like this -- but at the end of the chain there must
    be a real renderer which does the drawing.

/**
    @class wxRendererNative

    First, a brief introduction to wxRendererNative and why it is needed.

    Usually wxWidgets uses the underlying low level GUI system to draw all the
    controls - this is what we mean when we say that it is a "native" framework.
    However not all controls exist under all (or even any) platforms and in this
    case wxWidgets provides a default, generic, implementation of them written in
    wxWidgets itself.

    These controls don't have the native appearance if only the standard
    line drawing and other graphics primitives are used, because the native
    appearance is different under different platforms while the lines are always
    drawn in the same way.

    This is why we have renderers: wxRendererNative is a class which virtualizes the
    drawing, i.e. it abstracts the drawing operations and allows you to draw say, a
    button, without caring about exactly how this is done. Of course, as we
    can draw the button differently in different renderers, this also allows us to
    emulate the native look and feel.

    So the renderers work by exposing a large set of high-level drawing functions
    which are used by the generic controls. There is always a default global
    renderer but it may be changed or extended by the user, see
    @ref page_samples_render.

    All drawing functions take some standard parameters:

    @li @a win - The window being drawn. It is normally not used and when
    it is it should only be used as a generic wxWindow
    (in order to get its low level handle, for example), but you should
    not assume that it is of some given type as the same renderer
    function may be reused for drawing different kinds of control.
    @li @a dc - The wxDC to draw on. Only this device
    context should be used for drawing. It is not necessary to restore
    pens and brushes for it on function exit but, on the other hand, you
    shouldn't assume that it is in any specific state on function entry:
    the rendering functions should always prepare it.
    @li @a rect - The bounding rectangle for the element to be drawn.
    @li @a flags - The optional flags (none by default) which can be a
    combination of the @ref wxCONTROL_FLAGS.

    Note that each drawing function restores the wxDC attributes if
    it changes them, so it is safe to assume that the same pen, brush and colours
    that were active before the call to this function are still in effect after it.

    each other because the version is only changed when an existing virtual
    function is modified or removed. The age, on the other hand, is incremented
    each time a new virtual method is added and so, at least for the compilers
    using a common C++ object model, the calling program is compatible with any
    renderer which has the age greater or equal to its age. This verification is
    done by IsCompatible() method.
