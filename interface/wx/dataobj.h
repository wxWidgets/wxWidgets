    @class wxDataFormat

    A wxDataFormat is an encapsulation of a platform-specific format handle
    which is used by the system for the clipboard and drag and drop operations.
    The applications are usually only interested in, for example, pasting data
    from the clipboard only if the data is in a format the program understands
    and a data format is something which uniquely identifies this format.

    On the system level, a data format is usually just a number (@c CLIPFORMAT
    under Windows or @c Atom under X11, for example) and the standard formats
    are, indeed, just numbers which can be implicitly converted to wxDataFormat.
    The standard formats are:

    @beginDefList
    @itemdef{wxDF_INVALID,
             An invalid format - used as default argument for functions taking
             a wxDataFormat argument sometimes.}
    @itemdef{wxDF_TEXT,
             Text format (wxString).}
    @itemdef{wxDF_BITMAP,
             A bitmap (wxBitmap).}
    @itemdef{wxDF_METAFILE,
             A metafile (wxMetafile, Windows only).}
    @itemdef{wxDF_FILENAME,
             A list of filenames.}
    @itemdef{wxDF_HTML,
             An HTML string. This is currently only valid on Mac and MSW.}
    @itemdef{wxDF_PNG,
             A PNG file. This is valid only on MSW. This constant is available
             since wxWidgets 3.1.5.}
    @endDefList

    As mentioned above, these standard formats may be passed to any function
    taking wxDataFormat argument because wxDataFormat has an implicit
    conversion from them (or, to be precise from the type
    @c wxDataFormat::NativeFormat which is the type used by the underlying
    platform for data formats).

    Aside the standard formats, the application may also use custom formats
    which are identified by their names (strings) and not numeric identifiers.
    Although internally custom format must be created (or @e registered) first,
    you shouldn't care about it because it is done automatically the first time
    the wxDataFormat object corresponding to a given format name is created.
    The only implication of this is that you should avoid having global
    wxDataFormat objects with non-default constructor because their
    constructors are executed before the program has time to perform all
    necessary initialisations and so an attempt to do clipboard format
    registration at this time will usually lead to a crash!

/**
    @class wxDataObject

    A wxDataObject represents data that can be copied to or from the clipboard,
    or dragged and dropped. The important thing about wxDataObject is that this
    is a 'smart' piece of data unlike 'dumb' data containers such as memory
    buffers or files. Being 'smart' here means that the data object itself
    should know what data formats it supports and how to render itself in each
    of its supported formats.

    A supported format, incidentally, is exactly the format in which the data
    can be requested from a data object or from which the data object may be
    set. In the general case, an object may support different formats on
    'input' and 'output', i.e. it may be able to render itself in a given
    format but not be created from data on this format or vice versa.
    wxDataObject defines the wxDataObject::Direction enumeration type which
    distinguishes between them.

    See wxDataFormat documentation for more about formats.

    Not surprisingly, being 'smart' comes at a price of added complexity. This
    is reasonable for the situations when you really need to support multiple
    formats, but may be annoying if you only want to do something simple like
    cut and paste text.

    To provide a solution for both cases, wxWidgets has two predefined classes
    which derive from wxDataObject: wxDataObjectSimple and
    wxDataObjectComposite. wxDataObjectSimple is the simplest wxDataObject
    possible and only holds data in a single format (such as HTML or text) and
    wxDataObjectComposite is the simplest way to implement a wxDataObject that
    does support multiple formats because it achieves this by simply holding
    several wxDataObjectSimple objects.

    So, you have several solutions when you need a wxDataObject class (and you
    need one as soon as you want to transfer data via the clipboard or drag and
    drop):

    -# Use one of the built-in classes.
        - You may use wxTextDataObject, wxBitmapDataObject wxFileDataObject,
          wxURLDataObject in the simplest cases when you only need to support
          one format and your data is either text, bitmap or list of files.
    -# Use wxDataObjectSimple
        - Deriving from wxDataObjectSimple is the simplest solution for custom
          data - you will only support one format and so probably won't be able
          to communicate with other programs, but data transfer will work in
          your program (or between different instances of it).
    -# Use wxDataObjectComposite
        - This is a simple but powerful solution which allows you to support
          any number of formats (either standard or custom if you combine it
          with the previous solution).
    -# Use wxDataObject directly
        - This is the solution for maximum flexibility and efficiency, but it
          is also the most difficult to implement.

    Please note that the easiest way to use drag and drop and the clipboard
    with multiple formats is by using wxDataObjectComposite, but it is not the
    most efficient one as each wxDataObjectSimple would contain the whole data
    in its respective formats. Now imagine that you want to paste 200 pages of
    text in your proprietary format, as well as Word, RTF, HTML, Unicode and
    plain text to the clipboard and even today's computers are in trouble. For
    this case, you will have to derive from wxDataObject directly and make it
    enumerate its formats and provide the data in the requested format on
    demand.

    Note that neither the GTK+ data transfer mechanisms for clipboard and drag
    and drop, nor OLE data transfer, @e copies any data until another application
    actually requests the data. This is in contrast to the 'feel' offered to
    the user of a program who would normally think that the data resides in the
    clipboard after having pressed 'Copy' - in reality it is only declared to
    be @e available.

    You may also derive your own data object classes from wxCustomDataObject
    for user-defined types. The format of user-defined data is given as a
    mime-type string literal, such as "application/word" or "image/png". These
    strings are used as they are under Unix (so far only GTK+) to identify a
    format and are translated into their Windows equivalent under Win32 (using
    the OLE IDataObject for data exchange to and from the clipboard and for
    drag and drop). Note that the format string translation under Windows is
    not yet finished.

    Each class derived directly from wxDataObject must override and implement
    all of its functions which are pure virtual in the base class. The data
    objects which only render their data or only set it (i.e. work in only one
    direction), should return 0 from GetFormatCount().

    reasons.

        base class, it is not guaranteed that it won't change in the future.

    @class wxTextDataObject

    wxTextDataObject is a specialization of wxDataObjectSimple for text data.
    It can be used without change to paste data into the wxClipboard or a
    wxDropSource. A user may wish to derive a new class from this class for
    providing text on-demand in order to minimize memory consumption when
    offering data in several formats, such as plain text and RTF because by
    default the text is stored in a string in this class, but it might as well
    be generated when requested. For this, GetTextLength() and GetText() will
    have to be overridden.

    Note that if you already have the text inside a string, you will not
    achieve any efficiency gain by overriding these functions because copying
    wxStrings is already a very efficient operation (data is not actually
    copied because wxStrings are reference counted).
