    @class wxSound

    This class represents a short sound (loaded from Windows WAV file), that
    can be stored in memory and played.

    Currently this class is implemented on Windows and Unix (and uses either
    Open Sound System or Simple DirectMedia Layer).

        possible to delete the object which is being asynchronously played any time
        after calling this function and the sound would continue playing, however this
        currently doesn't work under Windows for sound objects loaded from memory data.

        The possible values for @a flags are:
        - wxSOUND_SYNC: @c Play will block and wait until the sound is replayed.
        - wxSOUND_ASYNC: Sound is played asynchronously, @c Play returns immediately.
        - wxSOUND_ASYNC|wxSOUND_LOOP: Sound is played asynchronously and loops
                                      until another sound is played, Stop() is
                                      called or the program terminates.

        wxSound(filename).Play(flags);
