/**
    @class wxFileDialog

    This class represents the file chooser dialog.

    The path and filename are distinct elements of a full file pathname.
    If path is ::wxEmptyString, the current directory will be used.
    If filename is ::wxEmptyString, no default filename will be supplied.
    The wildcard determines what files are displayed in the file selector,
    and file extension supplies a type extension for the required filename.

    The typical usage for the open file dialog is:
    @code
    void MyFrame::OnOpen(wxCommandEvent& WXUNUSED(event))
    {
        if (...current content has not been saved...)
        {
            if (wxMessageBox(_("Current content has not been saved! Proceed?"), _("Please confirm"),
                             wxICON_QUESTION | wxYES_NO, this) == wxNO )
                return;
            //else: proceed asking to the user the new file to open
        }

        wxFileDialog
            openFileDialog(this, _("Open XYZ file"), "", "",
                           "XYZ files (*.xyz)|*.xyz", wxFD_OPEN|wxFD_FILE_MUST_EXIST);

        if (openFileDialog.ShowModal() == wxID_CANCEL)
            return;     // the user changed idea...

        // proceed loading the file chosen by the user;
        // this can be done with e.g. wxWidgets input streams:
        wxFileInputStream input_stream(openFileDialog.GetPath());
        if (!input_stream.IsOk())
        {
            wxLogError("Cannot open file '%s'.", openFileDialog.GetPath());
            return;
        }

        ...
    }
    @endcode

    The typical usage for the save file dialog is instead somewhat simpler:
    @code
    void MyFrame::OnSaveAs(wxCommandEvent& WXUNUSED(event))
    {
        wxFileDialog
            saveFileDialog(this, _("Save XYZ file"), "", "",
                           "XYZ files (*.xyz)|*.xyz", wxFD_SAVE|wxFD_OVERWRITE_PROMPT);

        if (saveFileDialog.ShowModal() == wxID_CANCEL)
            return;     // the user changed idea...

        // save the current contents in the file;
        // this can be done with e.g. wxWidgets output streams:
        wxFileOutputStream output_stream(saveFileDialog.GetPath());
        if (!output_stream.IsOk())
        {
            wxLogError("Cannot save current contents in file '%s'.", saveFileDialog.GetPath());
            return;
        }

        ...
    }
    @endcode


    @section filedialog_filters Wildcard Filters

    All implementations of the wxFileDialog provide a wildcard filter. Typing a filename
    containing wildcards (*, ?) in the filename text item, and clicking on Ok, will
    result in only those files matching the pattern being displayed.
    The wildcard may be a specification for multiple types of file with a description
    for each, such as:
    @code
         "BMP and GIF files (*.bmp;*.gif)|*.bmp;*.gif|PNG files (*.png)|*.png"
    @endcode

    On Mac macOS in the open file dialog the filter choice box is not shown by default.
    Instead all given wildcards are applied at the same time: So in the above
    example all bmp, gif and png files are displayed. To enforce the
    display of the filter choice set the corresponding wxSystemOptions before calling
    the file open dialog:
    @code
         wxSystemOptions::SetOption(wxOSX_FILEDIALOG_ALWAYS_SHOW_TYPES, 1)
    @endcode
    But in contrast to Windows and Unix, where the file type choice filters only
    the selected files, on Mac macOS even in this case the dialog shows all files
    matching all file types. The files which does not match the currently selected
    file type are greyed out and are not selectable.


    @section filedialog_customize Dialog Customization

    Uniquely among the other standard dialogs, wxFileDialog can be customized
    by adding extra controls to it. Moreover, there are two ways to do it: the
    first one is to define a callback function and use SetExtraControlCreator()
    to tell the dialog to call it, while the second one requires defining a
    class inheriting from wxFileDialogCustomizeHook and implementing its
    virtual functions, notably wxFileDialogCustomizeHook::AddCustomControls()
    where the extra controls have to be created, and finally calling
    SetCustomizeHook() with this custom hook object.

    The first approach is somewhat simpler and more flexible, as it allows to
    create any kind of custom controls, but is not supported by the "new style"
    (where "new" means used since Windows Vista, i.e. circa 2007) file dialogs
    under MSW. Because of this, calling SetExtraControlCreator() in wxMSW
    forces the use of old style (Windows XP) dialogs, that may look out of
    place. The second approach is implemented by the MSW dialogs natively and
    doesn't suffer from this limitation, so its use is recommended, especially
    if the few simple control types supported by it (see wxFileDialogCustomize
    for more information about the supported controls) are sufficient for your
    needs.

    Both of the approaches to the dialog customization are demonstrated in the
    @ref page_samples_dialogs, please check it for more details.


    @beginStyleTable
    @style{wxFD_DEFAULT_STYLE}
           Equivalent to @c wxFD_OPEN.
    @style{wxFD_OPEN}
           This is an open dialog; usually this means that the default
           button's label of the dialog is "Open". Cannot be combined with @c wxFD_SAVE.
    @style{wxFD_SAVE}
           This is a save dialog; usually this means that the default button's
           label of the dialog is "Save". Cannot be combined with @c wxFD_OPEN.
    @style{wxFD_OVERWRITE_PROMPT}
           For save dialog only: prompt for a confirmation if a file will be
           overwritten.
           This style is always enabled on wxOSX and cannot be disabled.
    @style{wxFD_NO_FOLLOW}
           Directs the dialog to return the path and file name of the selected
           shortcut file, not its target as it does by default. Currently this
           flag is only implemented in wxMSW and wxOSX (where it prevents
           aliases from being resolved). The non-dereferenced link path
           is always returned, even without this flag, under Unix and so using
           it there doesn't do anything. This flag was added in wxWidgets
           3.1.0.
    @style{wxFD_FILE_MUST_EXIST}
           For open dialog only: the user may only select files that actually
           exist. Notice that under macOS the file dialog with @c wxFD_OPEN
           style always behaves as if this style was specified, because it is
           impossible to choose a file that doesn't exist from a standard macOS
           file dialog.
    @style{wxFD_MULTIPLE}
           For open dialog only: allows selecting multiple files.
    @style{wxFD_CHANGE_DIR}
           Change the current working directory (when the dialog is dismissed)
           to the directory where the file(s) chosen by the user are.
    @style{wxFD_PREVIEW}
           Show the preview of the selected files (currently only supported by
           wxGTK).
    @style{wxFD_SHOW_HIDDEN}
          Show hidden files. This flag was added in wxWidgets 3.1.3
