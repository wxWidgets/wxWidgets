/*
   I have been asked several times about writing some documentation about
   the GTK port of wxWidgets, especially its internal structures. Obviously,
   you cannot understand wxGTK without knowing a little about the GTK, but
   some more information about what the wxWindow, which is the base class
   for all other window classes, does seems required as well.

   I)

   What does wxWindow do? It contains the common interface for the following
   jobs of its descendants:

   1) Define the rudimentary behaviour common to all window classes, such as
   resizing, intercepting user input (so as to make it possible to use these
   events for special purposes in a derived class), window names etc.

   2) Provide the possibility to contain and manage children, if the derived
   class is allowed to contain children, which holds true for those window
   classes which do not display a native GTK widget. To name them, these
   classes are wxPanel, wxScrolledWindow, wxDialog, wxFrame. The MDI frame-
   work classes are a special case and are handled a bit differently from
   the rest. The same holds true for the wxNotebook class.

   3) Provide the possibility to draw into a client area of a window. This,
   too, only holds true for classes that do not display a native GTK widget
   as above.

   4) Provide the entire mechanism for scrolling widgets. This actual inter-
   face for this is usually in wxScrolledWindow, but the GTK implementation
   is in this class.

   5) A multitude of helper or extra methods for special purposes, such as
   Drag'n'Drop, managing validators etc.

   6) Display a border (sunken, raised, simple or none).

   Normally one might expect, that one wxWidgets window would always correspond
   to one GTK widget. Under GTK, there is no such allround widget that has all
   the functionality. Moreover, the GTK defines a client area as a different
   widget from the actual widget you are handling. Last but not least some
   special classes (e.g. wxFrame) handle different categories of widgets and
   still have the possibility to draw something in the client area.
   It was therefore required to write a special purpose GTK widget, that would
   represent a client area in the sense of wxWidgets capable to do the jobs
   2), 3) and 4). I have written this class and it resides in win_gtk.c of
   this directory.

   All windows must have a widget, with which they interact with other under-
   lying GTK widgets. It is this widget, e.g. that has to be resized etc and
   the wxWindow class has a member variable called m_widget which holds a
   pointer to this widget. When the window class represents a GTK native widget,
   this is (in most cases) the only GTK widget the class manages. E.g. the
   wxStaticText class handles only a GtkLabel widget a pointer to which you
   can find in m_widget (defined in wxWindow)

   When the class has a client area for drawing into and for containing children
   it has to handle the client area widget (of the type GtkPizza, defined in
   win_gtk.c), but there could be any number of widgets, handled by a class
   The common rule for all windows is only, that the widget that interacts with
   the rest of GTK must be referenced in m_widget and all other widgets must be
   children of this widget on the GTK level. The top-most widget, which also
   represents the client area, must be in the m_wxwindow field and must be of
   the type GtkPizza.

   As I said, the window classes that display a GTK native widget only have
   one widget, so in the case of e.g. the wxButton class m_widget holds a
   pointer to a GtkButton widget. But windows with client areas (for drawing
   and children) have a m_widget field that is a pointer to a GtkScrolled-
   Window and a m_wxwindow field that is pointer to a GtkPizza and this
   one is (in the GTK sense) a child of the GtkScrolledWindow.

   If the m_wxwindow field is set, then all input to this widget is inter-
   cepted and sent to the wxWidgets class. If not, all input to the widget
   that gets pointed to by m_widget gets intercepted and sent to the class.

   II)

   The design of scrolling in wxWidgets is markedly different from that offered
   by the GTK itself and therefore we cannot simply take it as it is. In GTK,
   clicking on a scrollbar belonging to scrolled window will inevitably move
   the window. In wxWidgets, the scrollbar will only emit an event, send this
   to (normally) a wxScrolledWindow and that class will call ScrollWindow()
   which actually moves the window and its subchildren. Note that GtkPizza
   memorizes how much it has been scrolled but that wxWidgets forgets this
   so that the two coordinates systems have to be kept in synch. This is done
   in various places using the pizza->xoffset and pizza->yoffset values.

   III)

   Singularily the most broken code in GTK is the code that is supposed to
   inform subwindows (child windows) about new positions. Very often, duplicate
   events are sent without changes in size or position, equally often no
   events are sent at all (All this is due to a bug in the GtkContainer code
   which got fixed in GTK 1.2.6). For that reason, wxGTK completely ignores
   GTK's own system and it simply waits for size events for toplevel windows
   and then iterates down the respective size events to all window. This has
   the disadvantage that windows might get size events before the GTK widget
   actually has the reported size. This doesn't normally pose any problem, but
   the OpenGL drawing routines rely on correct behaviour. Therefore, I have
   added the m_nativeSizeEvents flag, which is true only for the OpenGL canvas,
   i.e. the wxGLCanvas will emit a size event, when (and not before) the X11
   window that is used for OpenGL output really has that size (as reported by
   GTK).

   IV)

   If someone at some point of time feels the immense desire to have a look at,
   change or attempt to optimise the Refresh() logic, this person will need an
   intimate understanding of what "draw" and "expose" events are and what
   they are used for, in particular when used in connection with GTK's
   own windowless widgets. Beware.

   V)

   Cursors, too, have been a constant source of pleasure. The main difficulty
   is that a GdkWindow inherits a cursor if the programmer sets a new cursor
   for the parent. To prevent this from doing too much harm, I use idle time
   to set the cursor over and over again, starting from the toplevel windows
   and ending with the youngest generation (speaking of parent and child windows).
   Also don't forget that cursors (like much else) are connected to GdkWindows,
   not GtkWidgets and that the "window" field of a GtkWidget might very well
   point to the GdkWindow of the parent widget (-> "window-less widget") and
   that the two obviously have very different meanings.
