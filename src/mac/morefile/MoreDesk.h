/*	¶ Open a volume's desktop database and return the desktop database refNum.
	The DTOpen function opens a volume's desktop database. It returns
	the reference number of the desktop database and indicates if the
	desktop database was created as a result of this call (if it was created,
	then it is empty).

	volName			input:	A pointer to the name of a mounted volume
							or nil.
	vRefNum			input:	Volume specification.
	dtRefNum		output:	The reference number of Desktop Manager's
							desktop database on the specified volume.
	newDTDatabase	output:	true if the desktop database was created as a
							result of this call and thus empty.
							false if the desktop database was already created,
							or if it could not be determined if it was already
							created.
	
	Result Codes

		nsvErr				-35		Volume not found
