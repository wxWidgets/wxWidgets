/*
	IMPORTANT NOTE:
	
	The use of full pathnames is strongly discouraged. Full pathnames are
	particularly unreliable as a means of identifying files, directories
	or volumes within your application, for two primary reasons:
	
	• 	The user can change the name of any element in the path at
		virtually any time.
	•	Volume names on the Macintosh are *not* unique. Multiple
		mounted volumes can have the same name. For this reason, the use of
		a full pathname to identify a specific volume may not produce the
		results you expect. If more than one volume has the same name and
		a full pathname is used, the File Manager currently uses the first
		mounted volume it finds with a matching name in the volume queue.
	
	In general, you should use a file’s name, parent directory ID, and
	volume reference number to identify a file you want to open, delete,
	or otherwise manipulate.
	
	If you need to remember the location of a particular file across
	subsequent system boots, use the Alias Manager to create an alias
	record describing the file. If the Alias Manager is not available, you
	can save the file’s name, its parent directory ID, and the name of the
	volume on which it’s located. Although none of these methods is
	foolproof, they are much more reliable than using full pathnames to
	identify files.
	
	Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to display a file’s full pathname
	to the user. For example, a backup utility might display a list of full
	pathnames of files as it copies them onto the backup medium. Or, a
	utility might want to display a dialog box showing the full pathname of
	a file when it needs the user’s confirmation to delete the file. No
	matter how unreliable full pathnames may be from a file-specification
	viewpoint, users understand them more readily than volume reference
	numbers or directory IDs. (Hint: Use the TruncString function from
	TextUtils.h with truncMiddle as the truncWhere argument to shorten
	full pathnames to a displayable length.)
	
	The following technique for constructing the full pathname of a file is
	intended for display purposes only. Applications that depend on any
	particular structure of a full pathname are likely to fail on alternate
	foreign file systems or under future system software versions.

/*	¶ Get a full pathname to a volume, directory or file.
	The GetFullPath function builds a full pathname to the specified
	object. The full pathname is returned in the newly created handle
	fullPath and the length of the full pathname is returned in
	fullPathLength. Your program is responsible for disposing of the
	fullPath handle.
	
	Note that a full pathname can be made to a file/directory that does not
	yet exist if all directories up to that file/directory exist. In this case,
	GetFullPath will return a fnfErr.
	
	vRefNum			input:	Volume specification.
	dirID			input:	Directory ID.
	name			input:	Pointer to object name, or nil when dirID
							specifies a directory that's the object.
	fullPathLength	output:	The number of characters in the full pathname.
							If the function fails to create a full
							pathname, it sets fullPathLength to 0.
	fullPath		output:	A handle to the newly created full pathname
							buffer. If the function fails to create a
							full pathname, it sets fullPath to NULL.
	
	Result Codes
		noErr				0		No error	
		nsvErr				-35		No such volume
