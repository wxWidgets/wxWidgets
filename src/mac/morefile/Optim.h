**
**	You may incorporate this sample code into your applications without
**	restriction, though the sample code has been provided "AS IS" and the
**	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are
**	not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code"
**	after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,
**	we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was
**	descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.
**
**	The Optimization changes to MoreFiles source and header files, along with
**	this file and OptimizationEnd.h, let you optimize the code produced
**	by MoreFiles in several ways.
**
**	1 -- MoreFiles contains extra code so that many routines can run under
**	Mac OS systems back to System 6. If your program requires a specific
**	version of Mac OS and your program checks for that version before
**	calling MoreFiles routines, then you can remove a lot of compatibility
**	code by defining one of the following to 1:
**
**		__MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER	// assume Mac OS 7.5.1 or later
**		__MACOSSEVENFIVEORLATER		// assume Mac OS 7.5 or later
**		__MACOSSEVENORLATER			// assume Mac OS 7.0 or later
**
**	By default, all compatibility code is ON.
**
**	2 -- You may disable Pascal calling conventions in all MoreFiles routines
**	except for system callbacks that require Pascal calling conventions.
**	This will make C programs both smaller and faster.
**	Just define __WANTPASCALELIMINATION to be 1 to turn this optimization on
**	when building MoreFiles for use from C programs (you'll need to keep
**	Pascal calling conventions when linking MoreFiles routines with Pascal
**	programs).
**
**	3 -- If Metrowerks compiler is used, "#pragma internal on" may help produce
**	better code. However, this option can also cause problems if you're
**	trying to build MoreFiles as a shared library, so it is by default not used.
**	Just define __USEPRAGMAINTERNAL to be 1 to turn this optimization on.
**
