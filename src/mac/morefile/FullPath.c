/*
	IMPORTANT NOTE:
	
	The use of full pathnames is strongly discouraged. Full pathnames are
	particularly unreliable as a means of identifying files, directories
	or volumes within your application, for two primary reasons:
	
	¥ 	The user can change the name of any element in the path at virtually
		any time.
	¥	Volume names on the Macintosh are *not* unique. Multiple
		mounted volumes can have the same name. For this reason, the use of
		a full pathname to identify a specific volume may not produce the
		results you expect. If more than one volume has the same name and
		a full pathname is used, the File Manager currently uses the first
		mounted volume it finds with a matching name in the volume queue.
	
	In general, you should use a fileÕs name, parent directory ID, and
	volume reference number to identify a file you want to open, delete,
	or otherwise manipulate.
	
	If you need to remember the location of a particular file across
	subsequent system boots, use the Alias Manager to create an alias record
	describing the file. If the Alias Manager is not available, you can save
	the fileÕs name, its parent directory ID, and the name of the volume on
	which itÕs located. Although none of these methods is foolproof, they are
	much more reliable than using full pathnames to identify files.
	
	Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to display a fileÕs full pathname to
	the user. For example, a backup utility might display a list of full
	pathnames of files as it copies them onto the backup medium. Or, a
	utility might want to display a dialog box showing the full pathname of
	a file when it needs the userÕs confirmation to delete the file. No
	matter how unreliable full pathnames may be from a file-specification
	viewpoint, users understand them more readily than volume reference
	numbers or directory IDs. (Hint: Use the TruncString function from
	TextUtils.h with truncMiddle as the truncWhere argument to shorten
	full pathnames to a displayable length.)
	
	The following technique for constructing the full pathname of a file is
	intended for display purposes only. Applications that depend on any
	particular structure of a full pathname are likely to fail on alternate
	foreign file systems or under future system software versions.
