/*
	The Optimization changes to MoreFiles source and header files, along with
	this file and OptimizationEnd.h, let you optimize the code produced
	by MoreFiles in several ways.
	
	1 -- MoreFiles contains extra code so that many routines can run under
	Mac OS systems back to System 6. If your program requires a specific
	version of Mac OS and your program checks for that version before
	calling MoreFiles routines, then you can remove a lot of compatibility
	code by defining one of the following to 1:
	
		__MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER	// assume Mac OS 7.5.1 or later
		__MACOSSEVENFIVEORLATER		// assume Mac OS 7.5 or later
		__MACOSSEVENORLATER			// assume Mac OS 7.0 or later
	
	If you're compiling 68K code, the default is to include all compatibility code.
	If you're compiling PowerPC code (TARGET_RT_MAC_CFM), the default is __MACOSSEVENORLATER
	If you're compiling for Carbon code (TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON), the default is __MACOSSEVENFIVEONEORLATER
	
	2 -- You may disable Pascal calling conventions in all MoreFiles routines
	except for system callbacks that require Pascal calling conventions.
	This will make 68K C programs both smaller and faster. 
	(PowerPC compilers ignore pascal calling conventions.)
	Just define __WANTPASCALELIMINATION to be 1 to turn this optimization on
	when building MoreFiles for use from C programs (you'll need to keep
	Pascal calling conventions when linking MoreFiles routines with Pascal
	programs).
	
	3 -- If Metrowerks compiler is used, "#pragma internal on" may help produce
	better code. However, this option can also cause problems if you're
	trying to build MoreFiles as a shared library, so it is by default not used.
	Just define __USEPRAGMAINTERNAL to be 1 to turn this optimization on.
