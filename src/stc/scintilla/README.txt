This directory contains copies of the src, include, lexers, and lexlib
directories from the Scintilla source distribution. All other code
needed to implement Scintilla on top of wxWidgets is located in the
directory above this one.

The current version of the Scintilla code is 3.7.2

These are the basic steps needed to update the version of Scintilla used by wxSTC.  

1. Copy include, lexers, lexlib and src folders to src/stc/scintilla

2. Examine diffs between the new src/stc/scintilla/include/Scintilla.iface
file and the previous version.  You should get familiar especially with
new method names or constants because some of them may need to be
tweaked to conform to similar naming patterns already used.  (See step
#6 below.)

3. Identify new source files and update build/bakefiles/scintilla.bkl
accordingly so the new files will get built.  Use bakefile to
regenerate the makefiles and project files.

4. Examine changes in src/stc/scintilla/include/Platform.h and
identify new or changed APIs that the wx "platform" will need to
provide to the rest of the Scintilla code.  Implement those changes in
src/stc/PlatWX.cpp.  You can use the win32 version of the platform
code from the Scintilla source tree as a guide if needed.  You may
have to make a few tweaks to src/stc/scintilla/include/Platform.h to
keep the compile working cleanly, but try to keep them minimal.

5. Adjust the version number in wxStyledTextCtrl::GetLibraryVersionInfo()
in src/stc/stc.cpp.in.

6. Edit the gen_iface.py file.  This is where the Scintilla.iface file
is read and the code for stc.h and stc.cpp is generated.  For all new
methods or constant names check if there are similarly named things
defined here that are having something special done to them, and then
do the same sort of thing for those new items.  For example if there
is a new AutoCFoo method, I add the line in gen_iface.py that will
cause the AutoCompFoo name to be used instead.  The same for any
methods dealing with "Fore" or "Back" colors, they are renamed to
Foreground and Background.  If there is a new method that could be
considered a "command function" (something that takes no parameters
and could conceivably be bound to a key event) then I make sure that
it's ID is in cmdValues or included in one of the existing ranges in
that list. Also, for any enums that begin with 'SCXX_' instead of
'SC_', add an entry to valPrefixes to make sure the new names for
constants are generated consistently.

7. Run gen_iface.py.  It's best to use python 2.6 or later.  If
using an earlier version, please delete any .pyc files generated.

8. Any other new methods should be checked to ensure that the
generated code is appropriate for what they are doing and if not then
in gen_iface.py you can supply custom function bodies for them
instead.

9. Add documentation code for any new methods to
interface/wx/stc/stc.h, also check any documentation-only changes from
Scintilla.iface and see if the existing docs for those items should be
updated too.  For new functions in Scintilla.iface, an entry should be
added to the docsMap and sinceAnnotations dictionaries in gen_docs.py.

10. Apply the fix for scintilla/src/UniConversion.h based on commit by
Vadim Zeitlin <vadim@wxwidgets.org> from March 5th, 2016.

This is required to avoid gcc warnings (and possibly errors with other
compilers) about ambiguous comparison operators due to our (wchar_t,
wxUniChar) overloads defined in wx/unichar.h.

-inline unsigned int UTF16CharLength(wchar_t uch) {
+inline unsigned int UTF16CharLength(wchar_t wch) {
+       const int uch = wch;

11. Build and test.

12. Submit patch to wxTrac.
