The test directory contains some unit and performance tests for Scintilla.

The tests can only be run on Windows or Linux/Qt using Python 2.7 or 3.x.
Python 2.7+ is required because the bytes string type and literals are available.
Scintilla must be built before running any tests.

A test application for Windows only is in xite.py and this can be run to experiment:
pythonw xite.py

To run the basic tests:
python simpleTests.py

There are some lexing tests with simple input files in several languages in the examples
subdirectory and their expected lexed states in *.styled where the start of each style
is marked with {styleNumber}, for example:
{15}<%@{16}language=javas{15}%>{0}

To run the lexing tests:
python lexTests.py

To check for performance regressions:
python performanceTests.py
While each test run will be different and the timer has only limited granularity, some results
from a 2 GHz Athlon with a DEBUG build are:
 0.187 testAddLine
. 0.203 testAddLineMiddle
. 0.171 testHuge
. 0.203 testHugeInserts
. 0.312 testHugeReplace
