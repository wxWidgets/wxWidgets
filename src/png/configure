  There is no \"configure\" script in this distribution of
  libpng-1.5.6.

  Instead, please copy the appropriate makefile for your system from the
  \"scripts\" directory.  Read the INSTALL file for more details.

  Update, July 2004: you can get a \"configure\" based distribution
  from the libpng distribution sites.  Download the file
  libpng-1.5.6.tar.gz, libpng-1.5.6.tar.xz, or libpng-1.5.6.tar.bz2

  If the line endings in the files look funny, which is likely to be the
  case if you were trying to run \"configure\" on a Linux machine, you may
  wish to get the other distribution of libpng.  It is available in both
  tar.gz/tar.xz (UNIX style line endings) and .7z/.zip (DOS style line
  endings) formats.
