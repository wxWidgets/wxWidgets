        Bug fixes:
             #32  Fix sharing of hash salt across parsers;
                    relevant where XML_ExternalEntityParserCreate is called
                    prior to XML_Parse, in particular (e.g. FBReader)
             #28  xmlwf: Auto-disable use of memory-mapping (and parsing
                    as a single chunk) for files larger than ~1 GB (2^30 bytes)
                    rather than failing with error "out of memory"
              #3  Fix double free after malloc failure in DTD code; commit
                    7ae9c3d3af433cd4defe95234eae7dc8ed15637f

                    XML_UNICODE_WCHAR_T was never meant to be used outside
                    of Windows; 4-byte wchar_t is common on Linux

                    and --disable-xml-context; default of context of 1024
                    bytes enabled unchanged
             #14  Drop AmigaOS 4.x code and includes
             #14  Drop ancient build systems:

        - Bug Fixes:
          #1742315: Harmful XML_ParserCreateNS suggestion.
          #1785430: Expat build fails on linux-amd64 with gcc version>=4.1 -O3.
          #1983953, 2517952, 2517962, 2649838: 
                Build modifications using autoreconf instead of buildconf.sh.
          #2815947, #2884086: OBJEXT and EXEEXT support while building.
          #2517938: xmlwf should return non-zero exit status if not well-formed.

        - New Features / API changes:
          Added new API member XML_SetHashSalt() that allows setting an initial
                value (salt) for hash calculations. This is part of the fix for
                bug #3496608 to randomize hash parameters.
          When compiled with XML_ATTR_INFO defined, adds new API member
                XML_GetAttributeInfo() that allows retrieving the byte
                offsets for attribute names and values (patch #3446384).
          Added CMake build system.
                See bug #2990652 and patch #3312568.
          Added run-benchmark target to Makefile.in - relies on testdata module
                present in the same relative location as in the repository.
          
Release 2.0.1 Tue June 5 2007
        - Fixed bugs #1515266, #1515600: The character data handler's calling
          of XML_StopParser() was not handled properly; if the parser was
          stopped and the handler set to NULL, the parser would segfault.
        - Fixed bug #1690883: Expat failed on EBCDIC systems as it assumed
          some character constants to be ASCII encoded.
        - Minor cleanups of the test harness.
        - Fixed xmlwf bug #1513566: "out of memory" error on file size zero.
        - Fixed outline.c bug #1543233: missing a final XML_ParserFree() call.
        - Fixes and improvements for Windows platform:
          bugs #1409451, #1476160, #1548182, #1602769, #1717322.
        - Build fixes for various platforms:
          HP-UX, Tru64, Solaris 9: patch #1437840, bug #1196180.
          All Unix: #1554618 (refreshed config.sub/config.guess).
                    #1490371, #1613457: support both, DESTDIR and INSTALL_ROOT,
                    without relying on GNU-Make specific features.
          #1647805: Patched configure.in to work better with Intel compiler.
        - Fixes to Makefile.in to have make check work correctly:
          bugs #1408143, #1535603, #1536684.
        - Added Open Watcom support: patch #1523242.

Release 2.0.0 Wed Jan 11 2006
        - We no longer use the "check" library for C unit testing; we
          always use the (partial) internal implementation of the API.
        - Report XML_NS setting via XML_GetFeatureList().
        - Fixed headers for use from C++.
        - XML_GetCurrentLineNumber() and  XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber()
          now return unsigned integers.
        - Added XML_LARGE_SIZE switch to enable 64-bit integers for
          byte indexes and line/column numbers.
        - Updated to use libtool 1.5.22 (the most recent).
        - Added support for AmigaOS.
        - Some mostly minor bug fixes. SF issues include: #1006708,
          #1021776, #1023646, #1114960, #1156398, #1221160, #1271642.

Release 1.95.8 Fri Jul 23 2004
        - Major new feature: suspend/resume.  Handlers can now request
          that a parse be suspended for later resumption or aborted
          altogether.  See "Temporarily Stopping Parsing" in the
          documentation for more details.
        - Some mostly minor bug fixes, but compilation should no
          longer generate warnings on most platforms.  SF issues
          include: #827319, #840173, #846309, #888329, #896188, #923913,
          #928113, #961698, #985192.

Release 1.95.7 Mon Oct 20 2003
        - Fixed enum XML_Status issue (reported on SourceForge many
          times), so compilers that are properly picky will be happy.
        - Introduced an XMLCALL macro to control the calling
          convention used by the Expat API; this macro should be used
          to annotate prototypes and definitions of callback
          implementations in code compiled with a calling convention
          other than the default convention for the host platform.
        - Improved ability to build without the configure-generated
          expat_config.h header.  This is useful for applications
          which embed Expat rather than linking in the library.
        - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues #458907, #609603,
          #676844, #679754, #692878, #692964, #695401, #699323, #699487,
          #820946.
        - Improved hash table lookups.
        - Added more regression tests and improved documentation.

Release 1.95.6 Tue Jan 28 2003
        - Added XML_FreeContentModel().
        - Added XML_MemMalloc(), XML_MemRealloc(), XML_MemFree().
        - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues #615606, #616863,
          #618199, #653180, #673791.
        - Enhanced the regression test suite.
        - Man page improvements: includes SF issue #632146.

Release 1.95.5 Fri Sep 6 2002
        - Added XML_UseForeignDTD() for improved SAX2 support.
        - Added XML_GetFeatureList().
        - Defined XML_Bool type and the values XML_TRUE and XML_FALSE.
        - Use an incomplete struct instead of a void* for the parser
          (may not retain).
        - Fixed UTF-8 decoding bug that caused legal UTF-8 to be rejected.
        - Finally fixed bug where default handler would report DTD
          events that were already handled by another handler.
          Initial patch contributed by Darryl Miles.
        - Removed unnecessary DllMain() function that caused static
          linking into a DLL to be difficult.
        - Added VC++ projects for building static libraries.
        - Reduced line-length for all source code and headers to be

Release 1.95.3 Mon Jun 3 2002
        - Added a project to the MSVC workspace to create a wchar_t
          version of the library; the DLLs are named libexpatw.dll.

Release 1.95.2 Fri Jul 27 2001
        - More changes to make MSVC happy with the build; add a single
          workspace to support both the library and xmlwf application.

Release 1.95.1 Sun Oct 22 15:11:36 EDT 2000
        - Changes to get expat to build under Microsoft compiler
        - Removed all aborts and instead return an UNEXPECTED_STATE error.
        - Fixed a bug where a stray '%' in an entity value would cause an
          abort.
        - Defined XML_SetEndNamespaceDeclHandler. Thanks to Darryl Miles for
          finding this oversight.
        - Changed default patterns in lib/Makefile.in to fit non-GNU makes
          Thanks to robin@unrated.net for reporting and providing an
          account to test on.

Release 1.95.0 Fri Sep 29 2000
        - XML_ParserCreate_MM
                Allows you to set a memory management suite to replace the
                standard malloc,realloc, and free.
        - XML_SetReturnNSTriplet
                If you turn this feature on when namespace processing is in
                effect, then qualified, prefixed element and attribute names
                are returned as "uri|name|prefix" where '|' is whatever
                separator character is used in namespace processing.
        - Merged in features from perl-expat
                o XML_SetElementDeclHandler
                o XML_SetAttlistDeclHandler
                o XML_SetXmlDeclHandler
                o XML_SetEntityDeclHandler
                o StartDoctypeDeclHandler takes 3 additional parameters:
                        sysid, pubid, has_internal_subset
                o Many paired handler setters (like XML_SetElementHandler)
                  now have corresponding individual handler setters
                o XML_GetInputContext for getting the input context of
                  the current parse position.
        - Added reference material
        - Packaged into a distribution that builds a sharable library
