<H2>
The XsMDICanvas Class
</H2>

<P>
This section describes how to build and manipulate an MDI using the
<I>XsMDICanvas</I> class.  Minimally, you must perform the following actions
to build and display an MDI canvas:

<OL>
<LI>Create the <I>XsMDICanvas</I> object.</LI>
<LI>Create the documents as instances of subclasses of <I>XsMDIWindow</I>.</LI>
<LI>Add the documents to the canvas</LI>
<LI>Show the canvas</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<B>Constructor and Destructor:</B>

<P>
The <I>XsMDICanvas</I> accepts two arguments:

<DL>
<DD>XsMDICanvas (const char *name, Widget parent)</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The <I>name</I> parameter specifies the name of the canvas and is used
as the widget name for the underlying implementation.  The <I>parent</I>
parameter specifies the widget that is to be used as the parent of the
canvas.

<P>
The <I>XsMDICanvas</I> destructor destroys the canvas, but it <B>does not</B>
destroy any of the underlying documents.  It is up to the application to
destroy these.

<P>
<B>Adding and removing documents:</B>

<P>
After the documents are created, they must be added to the canvas.  The
<I>XsMDICanvas::add()</I> member-function adds documents to the canvas:

<DL>
<DD>virtual void add (XsMDIWindow *window)</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The behavior of adding the same document to the canvas more than once
is undefined.  Documents can be removed from the canvas by using:

<DL>
<DD>virtual void remove (XsMDIWindow *window)</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Additionally, all documents can be removed from the canvas with:

<DL>
<DD>void removeAll ( )</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The number of documents currently installed in the canvas can be
retrieved with:

<DL>
<DD>int numWindows ( ) const</DD>
</DL>

<P>
<B>Showing the canvas:</B>

<P>
In order to show (manage) the canvas call the <I>show</I> member function:

<DL>
<DD>virtual void show ( )</DD>
</DL>

This member-function is responsible for cycling all of the installed documents
and calling their respective <I>XsMDIWindow::_buildClientArea()</I>
member-functions.  After each document has been created, <I>show</I> will then
manage each document and, finally, itself.

<P>
<B>Window Placement:</B>

<P>
The current implementation of <I>XsMDICanvas</I> uses a very simple algorithm
to place the documents on the canvas.  In order to implement a more specific
placement algorithm, derive a class from <I>XsMDICanvas</I> and override
the member-function:

<DL>
<DD>virtual  void _placeWindow (XsMDIWindow *win)</DD>
</DL>

<P>
This member-function is called for each document in the canvas to compute
the location of the document.  Please refer to the code (<I>XsMDICanvas.C</I>)
for more details.

<P>
<B>Canvas Behavior:</B>

<P>
The <I>XsMDICanvas</I> is implemented as an <I>XmScrolledWindow</I> with an
<I>XmDrawingArea</I> work-window.  The instance name for the work-window
is <I>canvas</I>.  Internal callbacks in the canvas class force the work-window
to be at-least the size of the clip-window.  This prevents documents from
being clipped as they are moved around.  

<P>
By default, the <I>XmDrawingArea</I> work-window has its <I>XmNresizePolicy</I>
set to <I>XmRESIZE_GROW</I>.  This will allow the work-area to grow to
whatever size necessary, but it will not automatically shrink as windows
are manipulated.  If different behavior is desired, the <I>XmNresizePolicy</I>
resource on the work-area can be set to <I>XmRESIZE_ANY</I>.  This will
force the work-window to recompute its size as windows are manipulated, and
it will grow and shrink as necessary.  However, the <I>XsMDICanvas</I> will
still force the work-area to be at-least the size of the clip-window.

<P>To change the default behavior, add the following resource:

<DL>
<DD>&ltXsMDICanvas name&gt*canvas.resizePolicy:   XmRESIZE_ANY</DD>
</DL>
