# Notes:
#
# Remove all of the tags below except for the last one when creating new
# development branch.
#
# Once a symbol has been included in a stable release of wxWidgets its version
# cannot be changed.
#
# With each new release a section should be added containing any new symbols,
# for example:
#
#   # public symbols added in release 2.6.2 (please keep in alphabetical order):
#   @WX_VERSION_TAG@.2 {
#       global:
#           *wxChoice*GetCurrentSelection*;
#   };
#
# If a symbols should have been added in this way, but is forgotten then it
# cannot be added in the next release. This is because it has already been
# released with the generic branch version due to the final wildcard below,
# and once released its version cannot be changed.


# public symbols added in 2.8.1 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.1 {
    global:
        # wx{Dir|File}Dialog::Get/SetStyle()
        *wxFileDialog*etStyle*;
        *wxDirDialog*etStyle*;
        # Mac OS X only, but it still must go in IIUC
        *wxListCtrl*SetFocus*;
		*wxListCtrl*OnChar*;
		*wxListCtrl*OnRightDown*;
		*wxListCtrl*OnMiddleDown*;
		*wxListCtrl*FireMouseEvent*;
        # wxTreeCtrl::CollapseAll[Children]() and IsEmpty
        *wxTreeCtrl*CollapseAll*;
        *wxTreeCtrl*IsEmpty*;
};

# symbols available since the beginning of this branch are only given
# generic branch tag (don't remove this!):

@WX_VERSION_TAG@ {
    global:
        *;
};
