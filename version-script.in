#
# Notes:
#
# Remove all of the tags below except for the last one when creating new
# development branch.
#
# Once a symbol has been included in a stable release of wxWidgets its version
# cannot be changed.
#
# With each new release a section should be added containing any new symbols,
# for example:
#
#   # public symbols added in release @WX_VERSION_TAG@.2 (please keep in alphabetical order):
#   @WX_VERSION_TAG@.2 {
#       extern "C++"
#           "wxChoice::GetCurrentSelection()";
#       };
#   };
#
# If a symbols should have been added in this way, but is forgotten then it
# cannot be added to the next release version tag, but we can workaround the
# problem by using wxELF_VERSION_COMPAT() macro in the source code. Note that
# this is why some version tags are defined here even if no symbols are
# assigned to them: they are used by that macro.

# When adding a new section here, don't forget to modify the version in
# build/bakefiles/version.bkl to indicate that new APIs have been added and
# rebake!

# public symbols added in 3.2.7 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.7 {
    extern "C++" {
        "wxAppConsoleBase::SetErrorExitCode(int)";
        "wxAppConsoleBase::GetErrorExitCode() const";
    };
};

# public symbols added in 3.2.6 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.6 {
};

# public symbols added in 3.2.3 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.3 {
};

# public symbols added in 3.2.2 (please keep in alphabetical order):
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.2 {
};

# public symbols added in 3.2.1
@WX_VERSION_TAG@.1 {
    extern "C++" {
        "wxApp::GTKAllowDiagnosticsControl()";
    };
};

# symbols available since the beginning of this branch are only given
# generic branch tag (don't remove this!):

@WX_VERSION_TAG@ {
        *;
};
