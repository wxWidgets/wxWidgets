Building wxPython on Mac OS X
-----------------------------

NOTE:  OS X support is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL at this time.  Most things
       don't work correctly (or at all) yet.

These are the steps I have used for building wxPython on Mac OS X 10.1
with the Apple Developer Tools, a.k.a the Darwin version.  I assume
that you know your way around a command line and that you know how to
get things from various CVS repositories as needed.


1. As of this writing the CVS version of Python (2.2b1+) is required.
   You can get it via anonymous CVS from the Python project at
   Sourceforge.  Build Python.app and install it as described in the
   Mac/OSX/README file in the Python distribution.

2. You may want to make a symlink or two in /usr/local/bin so that
   this version of Python can be found from the command line.  For
   example:

        cd /usr/local/bin
	sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.2/bin/python2.2.exe python2.2
        sudo ln -s python2.2 python

3. In a wxWindows CVS tree make a build directory.

	cd ~/proj/wxWindows	# or wherever you put it
	mkdir build

4. Run configure from that build directory.

        cd build
	../configure --with-mac --with-opengl --enable-debug

5. Make and install wxMac.

	make
	sudo make install

6. Build wxPython for testing (without installing it.)

	cd ../wxPython
	python setup.py IN_CVS_TREE=1 build_ext --inplace --debug

7. Test.  The easiest way to do this from the CVS tree (witout having
   to reinstall after every build) is to make a symlink in the demo
   directory to the wxPython package dir, and then run stuff directly
   from the demo.

	cd demo
	ln -s ../wxPython .

8. Now just navigate in the Finder to the demo directory and double
   click demo.py, or simple.py, or whatever you want to run.
   (Unfortunately it can't be done from the commandline in a terminal
   window.  You can open the Console app to see any tracebacks or
   other output.)

9. Figure out what's wrong, figure out how to fix it, and then send
   the patches to me.  <wink>
