Recent Changes for wxPython
=====================================================================

2.5.3.0
-------

wxMac focus and border refreshes corrected.

Updated internal PNG library.

wxMac fix for metal appearance on wx.ToolBar.

wx.grid.Grid fix allowing DoGetBestSize to be called before CreateGrid
(which means that a min size doesn't need to be specified.)

wxMac fix for not sending a native click to a control if it is not
enabled (does an enable itself)

Added wx.lib.ogl.DrawnShape, and fixed various little bugs in the new
OGL. 

Added support to XRC and XRCed for the 3-state checkbox flags and also
for wx.ToggleButton.  Updated the generic window styles supported by
XRCed. 

It is now possible to create "stock" buttons.  Basically this means
that you only have to provide one of the stock IDs (and either an
empty label or a label that matches the stock label) when creating the
button and wxWidgets will choose the stock label to go with it
automatically.  Additionally on the platforms that have a native
concept of a stock button (currently only GTK2) then the native stock
button will be used.  For example, the following will result in a
button with "Cancel" as the label and an accelerator on the "C", and
if run on wxGTK2 then there will also be an image of a red X::

       b = wx.Button(parent, wx.ID_CANCEL) 


Added wx.lib.ticker.Ticker class from Chris Mellon.

Fix some incorrect clipping regions in wxSTC on wxGTK.

Added wrapper for wx.grid.Grid.GetOrCreateCellAttr.

Removed my copy of distutils from the wxPython source tree.  Now that
I am no longer doing builds on Python 2.1 the newest distutils is no
longer needed.  (There is still one small bug in Python 2.2 distutils
on win32, but it is easily worked around.) This sovles the problem of
incorrect builds on some systems where the system installed distutils
has been patched to behave slightly differently, for example SuSE on
x86_64 or Chandler's build.

Updated to SWIG 1.3.22 (plus my patch.)  See wxPython/SWIG/README.txt
in the source tree if you need to use SWIG when building your own copy
of wxPython, or other extension modules that need to integrate with
the wxPython modules.

Added wx.Frame.RequestUserAttention which, if the platform suports it,
will do something (such as flash the task bar item) to suggest to the
user that they should look at that window.

"Fixed" wx.grid.Grid.SetDefaultEditor and SetDefaultRenderer by making
them register the editor or renderer for the "string" data type.

Added depth param to wx.Image.ConvertToBitmap.

Extended the wx.calendar.CalendarCtrl class with methods that get/set
a Python datetime or date object.  (These will only work with Python
2.3+) The methods are PySetDate, PyGetDate, PySetLowerDateLimit,
PySetUpperDateLimit, PySetDateRange, PyGetLowerDateLimit, and
PyGetUpperDateLimit.  Also, CalendarEvent was extended with PySetDate
and PyGetDate methods.

wxMSW: SetBackgroundColour on a wx.Choice or a wx.ComboBox will now
also set the colour of the dropdown.

wxMac: MessageDialog now supports wx.NO_DEFAULT style

wxMSW: added AssociateHandle and DissociateHandle to wx.Window

wxMac: fix for toolbar tooltips

wx.Sizer.Show (and Hide) now take an optional parameter specifying if
the item to be shown should be searched for recursivly in subsizers,
and return a boolean value indicating if the item was found.

wxMSW: fixed MaximizeEvent generation in wx.Frame

wxMSW: fixed sending duplicate EVT_COMBOBOX events

Smoother time estimation updates in wx.ProgressDialog (patch 992813)

Made wx.Listbook events more consistent with wx.Notebook ones (patch
1001271)

Fixed rounding errors in variable status bar panes widths computation
(patch 1030021)

Added possibility to specify printer bin (patch 910272)

wxMSW: fixed wx.ListCtrl's SetWindowStyleFlag() to not remove
WS_VISIBLE; also refresh the control automatically (closes bug
1019440)

Added wx.Choicebook, yet another notebook-like control.

wxMSW: Make radiobutton tab behaviour the same on MSW as in standard
MSW app, i.e. tab into the activated, not necessarily the first radio
button.

Added limited support for wxEventLoop (you can't derive from a
wx.PyEventLoop version yet...)  Updated and moved the sample showing
how to replace the MainLoop to samples/mainloop/mainloop.py.

The C++ xrc lib has been moved out of contrib and into the core, so it
is always built by default.  wxPython's build has also changed
accordingly and will build the xrc module as part of the core set of
modules built by default.  If you were axplicitly using BUILD_XRC then
it will no longer be recognized as a build option, otherwise you
should notice no difference.

wxMac: Fixed radio toolbar buttons to correctly untoggle the others
when a new one is selected.

wxMac: Fixed GetLineLength and GetLineText for MLTE text controls

wxMac: wx.TaskBarIcon is implemented by allowing you to change the
app's icon on the Dock and also specifying a menu that should be
merged with the normal dock popup menu.  See the MigrationGuide for
more details and a warning.

Added wx.TopLevelWindow.IsActive() which tells you if the frame or
dialog is or containts the active window with the keyboard focus.

Added ability to create a font based on pixel size rather than point
size via the FontFromPixelSize constructor.

Updated the Scintilla used by StyledTextCtrl to version 1.61

Improved image HitTest for TreeListCtrl.

Added wx.App.IsMainLoopRunning.

wxGTK: Make wxComboBox spit out a bit fewer surplus events when
holding down the mouse button.

wxGTK: Enable key based navigation through notebook tabs as in the
native control with Left and right keys. Support for vetoing.

FloatCanvas updates from Chris Barker

PyPlot updates from Gordon Williams:
   - Added bar graph demo
   - Modified line end shape from round to square.
   - Removed FloatDCWrapper for conversion to ints and ints in arguments


MaskedEdit updates from Will Sadkin:
    - Added '*' mask char that means "all ansii chars" (ords 32-255)
    - Added proper unicode support to masked controls and wx.tools.dbg
    - Fixed two reported missing import bugs introduced by package
      creation
    - Converted masked package doc strings to reST format for better
      epydoc support
    - lots of doc string improvements and function hiding to better
      reflect package's public contents.





2.5.2.8
-------

Predominantly a bug-fix release.

  * Fixed fatal error due to improper wrapping of wx.FSFile.

  * Fixed return type of EditableListBox.GetListCtrl

  * Give generic tree and list controls a DoGetBestSize so they play
    nicer with sizers when there is no minimal size.

  * Some tweaks in the demo and samples to correct layout, some
    flicker problems, and namespace use.

  * Add wx.Image.ConvertAlphaToMask

  * Minor corrections in wx.lib.dialogs

  * wx.FileHistory constructor now accepts the documented 2nd
    parameter.

  * Corrections for exceptions in the new ogl

  * Fixed XRCed to not use reparenting of windows to implement caching
    of property panels, since Reparent on wxMac is not implemented.

  * Add support for wxTAB_TRAVERSAL to the XRC handler for
    wxScrolledWindow. 

  * Add support for all wxListBox styles to the XRC handler for
    wxCheckListBox. 

  * Fix for wx.Listbook.DeleteAllPages to really delete everything.

  * wxGTK2 now supports alpha blended bitmap drawing

  * Made wx.grid.Grid play nicer with sizers.

  * etc.




2.5.2.7
-------

wx.ADJUST_MINSIZE is now the default behaviour for window items in
sizers.  This means that the item's GetMinSize and/or GetBestSize will
be called when calculating layout and the return value from that will
be used for the minimum size used by the sizer.  The wx.FIXED_MINSIZE
flag was added that will cause the sizer to use the old behaviour in
that it will *not* call the window's methods to determine the new best
size, instead the minsize that the window had when added to the sizer
(or the size the window was created with) will always be used.  Please
see the Sizers section in the Migration Guide for more details.

Added new MaskedEditControl code from Will Sadkin.  The modules are
now locaed in their own sub-package, wx.lib.masked.  Demos updated.

The changes that implemented the incompatible wx.DC methods in 2.5.1.5
have been reverted.  The wx.DC methods are now compatible with the 2.4
implemetation.  In addition a set of renamed methods have been added
that take wx.Point and/or wx.Size objects instead of individual
parameters. 

Added wx.lib.mixins.listctrl.TextEditMixin, a mixin class that allows
all columns of a wx.ListCtrl in report mode to be edited.

Deprecated the wx.iewin module.

Deprecated the wx.Sizer.AddWindow, AddSizer, AddSpacer methods as well
as their Insert* and Prepend* counterparts.

Added a generic StaticBitmap class in wx.lib.statbmp for the same
reasons that stattext was created, so it could be mouse sensitive on
all platforms like normal windows.  Also updated stattext.py and
buttons.py to handle attribute (font & colour) defaults and
inheritance the new way.  If you have custom controls of your own you
should review stattxt.py or one of the others to see how it is to be
done.

wx.InitAllImageHandlers is now an empty function that does nothing but
exist for backwards compatibility.  The C++ version is now called
automatically when wxPython is initialized.  Since all the handlers
are included in the wxWidgets shared library anyway, this imposes only
a very small amount of overhead and removes several unneccessary
problems.

Replaced wx/lib/pubsub.py with a version that uses weak references to
track the subscribers, plus other fixes/additions.  Thanks go to
Oliver Schoenborn and Robb Shecter.

wxGTK now uses gtk_init_check so wxPython can raise an exception if
there is no DISPLAY available or other initializaion problem.

wx.GetKeyState now has an implementation for wxGTK and is able to
detect the up/down or toggle state of modifier and toggle keys.

The LC_NUMERIC locale is now reset back to "C" (compatibility) when
running on wxGTK to work around the fact that GTK requires the locale
to be set to the system settings but Python depends on LC_NUMERIC
remaining compatible with "C".

Switched gizmos.TreeListCtrl to the newer version of the code from the
wxCode project.

OGL is dead! LONG LIVE OGL!  (Oops, sorry.  A bit of my dramatic side
leaked out there...)  The wx.ogl module has been deprecated in favor
of the new Python port of the OGL library located at wx.lib.ogl
contributed by Pierre Hjälm.  This will hopefully greatly extend the
life of OGL within wxPython by making it more easily maintainable and
less prone to getting rusty as there seems to be less and less
interest in maintaining the C++ version.  At this point there are just
a couple minor known compatibility differences, please see the
MigrationGuide_ file for details.

.. _MigrationGuide: MigrationGuide.html

EVT_STC_POSCHANGED has been removed as it has been deprecated in
Scintilla for several releases now.

All the Window and GDI (pen, bitmap, etc.) class constructors and also
many toplevel functions and static methods will now check that a
wx.App object has already been created and will raise a
wx.PyNoAppError exception if not.

Added more default args as needed to allow most window types to be
constructed with only the parent window arg.  In some cases other args
may be required for normal operation, but they can usually be set
after construction.

Removed the deprecated ErrorDialogs and PythonBitmaps modules.  If you
were using these in your apps then please join wxPython-dev and assist
with a more modern reimplementation.

Added a new version (0.8.3) of FloatCanvas from Chris Barker.  It's now
in a subpackage of wx.lib.

It is now possible to change the tab traversal order of controls on a
panel or dialog.  For details see the new MoveAfterInTabOrder and
MoveBeforeInTabOrder methods of wx.Window.

Applied (and heavily modified) a patch from Eugene
<svip123@fastmail.fm> that allows the sample modules in the demo to be
edited and reloaded, all from within the demo.  You can switch back
and forth between the default and your edited version, and any errors
ocurring upon the reload are reported on the Demo tab.

Added a menu item in the demo that will open a PyShell window that has
the app and demo frame preloaded in the namespace.  This is another
good way to explore and play with the objects in the currently running
sample.  For example, load the Button sample and then do the following
in the PyShell::

	>>> b = frame.demoPage.GetChildren()[0]
	>>> for x in range(0, 500, 10):
	...     b.Move((x, 50))
	...     app.Yield(True)
	...     wx.MilliSleep(10)




2.5.1.5
-------

(See also the MigrationGuide_ file for details about some of the
big changes that have happened in this release and how you should
adapt your code.)

.. _MigrationGuide: MigrationGuide.html


The wxWindows project and library is now known as wxWidgets.  Please
see http://www.wxwindows.org/name.htm for more details.  This won't
really affect wxPython all that much, other than the fact that the
wxwindows.org domain name will be changing to wxwidgets.org, so mail
list, CVS, and etc. addresses will be changing.  We're going to try
and smooth the transition as much as possible, but I wanted you all to
be aware of this change if you run into any issues.


Many, many little fixes, changes and additions done as part of the move
to wxWidgets 2.5 that I have forgotten about.

Added wxMirrorDC.

Added wxIconLocation

Added Python wrappers and demos for the new wxVScrolledWindow,
wxVListBox, and wxHtmlListBox classes.

Added wrappers for wxBookCtrl and wxListbook.  wxNotebook now derives
from wxBookCtrl.

Added Gordon Williams' PyPlot module to the library, available as the
wx.lib.plot module.

I made a small but important change in the code that aquires the
Python Global Interpreter Lock to try and prevent deadlocks that can
happen when there are nested attempts to aquire the GIL.

The RPMs will now install menu items on Mandrake Linux in
Applications/Development/Tools for PyCrust, XRCed, etc.  The RPMs are
also installing icons and ``*.desktop`` items in the generic KDE and
GNOME locations, but I don't know yet if they are resulting in menu
items on non-Mandrake systems.  (It didn't automatically do it on my
RH-9 build box but I didn't chase it very far...)  If you have ideas
for how to improve the .spec file to work better and/or on more
distros please send me a patch.

The RPMs are now built on a fairly generic RH-9 box, and I have tested
installing them also on my main Mandrake 9.2 box.

There are some big changes in the OS X disk image.  The actual
Installer package now *only* installs the wxMac dynlibs, wxPython
extension modules and Python packages, and also the command-line tool
scripts. The remaining items (demo, samples, and application bundles
for the Demo, PyCrust and XRCed) are now top-level items in the disk
image (.dmg file) that users can just drag and drop to wherever they
want to put them.

The wxWave class has been renamed to wxSound, and now has a slightly
different API.

Updated the AnalogClockWindow with many enhancements from E. A. Tacão.

wxMac now has wx.ToggleButton!

wx.stc.StyledTextCtrl has been updated to version 1.58 of Scintilla.

To help with the wx.stc.StyledTextCtrl performance issues on wxMac
I've added a SetUseAntiAliasing method (and GetUseAntiAliasing too)
that will turn off the use of antialiased fonts in the wxSTC, allowing
it to bypass the slow text measuring routines and use the fast and
simple one instead.  By default the setting is turned off (on wxMac
only.)  When run on OSX the Py* apps have a new item on the Options
menu for controlling this setting if you would like to experiment with
it.

Updated wx.lib.calendar with many fixes and enhancements from Joerg
"Adi" Sieker. 

Added wx.Display and wx.VideoMode.

AppleEvents can be handled by overriding wx.App methods MacOpenFile,
MacPrintFile, MacNewFile, and MacReopenApp.

Added wx.PlatformInfo which is a tuple containing strings that
describe the platform and build options of wxPython.  See the
MigrationGuide for more details.

Created a new extension module "activex" from Lindsay Mathieson's
newest wxActiveX_ class.  (The existing iewin module used an older
version of this code, but only exposed the wxIEHtmlWin class.)  This
new module will (in theory ;-) ) allow you to host arbitrary ActiveX
controls in a wx.Window, **without** requiring the use of the win32com
and other PyWin32 modules!  This should eliminate the cronic problems
that have resulted from minor mismatches in how PyWin32 handles the
GIL and tstate when making callbacks, etc.  The older iewin module
will be left in this release as the new stuff is not fully backwards
compatible, but you should migrate your code to the new IEHtmlWindow
in wx.lib.iewin, so the old one can be eventually removed.
Additionally, I've always considered that the wx.lib.activexwrapper
module is an ugly hack that I only included in the lib because I
couldn't figure out anything better.  Well now we have something that,
if it isn't already, has the potential to be better.  So consider
migrating away from using activexwrapper as well.  Please see the
MigrationGuide for more details on using the new module.

.. _wxActiveX: http://members.optusnet.com.au/~blackpaw1/wxactivex.html

Floats are allowed again as function parameters where ints are expected.




2.4.2.4
-------

Use wxSTC in the demo for displaying the soucre code of the samples.

Lots of bug fixes and such from the wxWindows folks.

Added wxPython.lib.newevent from Miki Tebeka.  Its usage is
demonstrated in the Threads sample in the demo.

Updates to wxMaskedEditCtrl.

Added wxMaskedNumCtrl.

Added Chris Barker's FloatCanvas.



2.4.1.2
-------

Added wxScrolledPanel from Will Sadkin

Added SetShape method to top level windows (e.g. wxFrame.)

Changed wxSWIG to not generate Python code using apply, (since it will
be deprecated in the future) wxSWIG will use ``spam(*args, **kw)`` syntax
instead.  Also changed the generated __repr__ methods to be a bit more
informative.

Made the version number information more robust and uh, informative.
Also added asserts to check that the major.minor versions of wxPython
and wxWindows match.

Added the new wx "renamer" package that will dynamically import from
the wxPython package and rename wxFooBar --> FooBar.  That means that
people can do imports without ``"import *"`` and can use names like
wx.Frame instead of wx.wxFrame.  This is phase 1 of a full transition
to the new namespace.

Updated Scintilla to 1.52.  I also changed it to use wxListCtrl
instead of wxListBox for the AutoComplete window, added the ability to
use custom bitmaps in the margin and in the AutoComplete windows, and
worked out how to do proper clipping of child windows on wxGTK.

Patrick O'Brien's PyCrust package has been renamed to Py and now
includes several new tools.  As part of the change the location of the
pacakge has changed as well, it is now accessible as "from wxPython
import py" (or "from wx import py" using the new namespace.)  There
are still some transition modules in the wxPython.lib.PyCrust package
that will issue a warning and then import what is needed from the new
package.  These will be removed in a future release.

Added __nonzero__ method to wxTreeItemId, wxBitmap, wxImage, wxFont,
and most other classes that have an Ok or IsOK method.  This allows
code like "if obj: ..." to be the same as "if obj.IsOk(): ..."

Toolbars on wxMac can now have controls on them.

Added wxPython.lib.analogclock module based on samples that were
passed back and forth on wxPython-users a while back.

Added masked edit controls (wxPython.lib.maskededit) by Jeff Childers
and Will Sadkin.  Updated wxTimeCtrl to use MaskedEdit.

When the __class__ of a dead object is replaced with _wxPyDeadObject
the __del__ of the original class is now called first.

Added wxTreeListCtrl.  (Looks like a wxTreeCtrl embedded in a
wxListCtrl, but actually is just giving multiple columns to a
wxTreeCtrl.)

Added wxFutureCall, a subclass of wxTimer that makes it easy to delay
a call to any Python callable object.

Added wxPy versions of wxPrintPreview, wxPreviewFrame, and
wxPreviewControlBar so they can be derived from in Python and be able
to override the C++ virtual methods.

Simplified how the wxSizer methods are wrapped, changed the name of
the "option" parameter to "proportion" to match the docs ("option" is
still accepted for compatibility, but this will go away in a future
release,) SetItemMinSize can now take a wxSize (or 2-tuple) parameter,
and Spacers can be specified with a wxSize (or 2-tuple) parameter

Added wxCursorFromBits.





2.4.0.7
-------

Gave up on generating a warning upon the use of the old true/false or
TRUE/FALSE values.

Fixed wxGenericTreeCtrl (used on wxGTK and wxMac for wxTreeCtrl) so
that it can successfully handle lots of nodes instead of overflowing
when the virtual height of the widget overflowed a 16-bit value.

Fixed the typemap that converts strings to wxColours to also accept
unicode.

Fixed problem where the wrong class name could sometimes be used for
OOR.

Fixed an interpreter lock problem in the __eq__ and __ne__ methods in
wxSize and etc.

Updated PyCrust to version 0.9

Instead of always logging C++ assertions, added wxPYAPP_ASSERT_LOG
flag to turn it on.  In most cases turning it into an exception (the
default behavior) is enough.  See below in the 2.3.4.1 notes for more
details.




2.4.0.6 (a.k.a. the I'm so stupid release)
------------------------------------------

The new deprecation class for the old true/false symbols can now be
returned from OnInit.  And I promise to be sure I am testing what I
think I am testing in the future...



2.4.0.5 (a.k.a. the blame it on Kevin release)
----------------------------------------------

A few little but annoying bug fixes.

Updated pycolourchooser.

Updated to 0.9b of PyCrust.



2.4.0.4
-------
Added missing wxRect methods

Add OOR support for wxApp objects too.

Added wxCursorFromImage, which works on wxMSW and wxGTK so far.

All platforms now send EVT_DESTROY_WINDOW.  Be warned that at the time
the event is sent the window is in the process of being deconstructed,
and so calling some (most?) methods of the window itself may cause
problems.

Fixed SF Bug #689481, a method in the OGL wrappers was using the wrong
return type.

Fixed SF Bug #689958, an endless loop in printout.py.

Added EVT_WINDOW_CREATE_ID and EVT_WINDOW_DESTROY_ID so these events
can be associated with a specific window ID and more easily caught by
the parent window.

Fixed copy-paste error in wxListCtrl.GetFirstSelected.

Added missing Init method (and an overloading wrapper) to wxLocale
wrapper.

Added a wxBitmap.SetMaskColour convenience method.

Changed how the dynamic event tables (used for all Python wx classes,
C++ wx classes typically use static event tables) are searched such
that they behave from a Python perspective more like the static tables
in C++.  Namely that if there are identical event bindings in a base
Python class and a derived Python class that the one in the derived
class will be found first and that if Skip is called that the one in
the base class will still be found instead of skipping directly to the
static stable in the C++ class.

Switched to using True/False in the wxPython lib and demo instead of
true/false or TRUE/FALSE to prepare for the new boolean type and
constants being added to Python.  Added code to wx.py to test for the
existence of the new constants and to create suitable values if not
present.

Added some static wxApp functions that help with integration with the
Mac UI.  They are no-ops on other platforms so it doesn't hurt to
always call them.  The functions are:

       wxApp_GetMacDefaultEncodingIsPC
       wxApp_GetMacSupportPCMenuShortcuts
       wxApp_GetMacAboutMenuItemId
       wxApp_GetMacPreferencesMenuItemId
       wxApp_GetMacExitMenuItemId
       wxApp_GetMacHelpMenuTitleName
       wxApp_SetMacDefaultEncodingIsPC
       wxApp_SetMacSupportPCMenuShortcuts
       wxApp_SetMacAboutMenuItemId
       wxApp_SetMacPreferencesMenuItemId
       wxApp_SetMacExitMenuItemId
       wxApp_SetMacHelpMenuTitleName

Refactored, enhanced and added capabilities for the DrawXXXList
functions, inspired by code from Chris Barker.

The wxWindows .mo language catalog files are now installed in a
subdirectory of the wxPython package dir on MSW since that platform
doesn't have a standard place for them.

Added missing deselect methods for wxGrid.

Fixed typemaps for wxGridCellCoordsArray.

Updated to the 0.9a version of PyCrust



2.4.0.2
-------
Several bug fixes.

Added wxIntCtrl from Will Sadkin.

Added wxPyColourChooser by Michael Gilfix.




2.4.0.1
-------
No major new features since 2.3.4.2, mostly bug fixes and minor
enhancements.

Added function wrappers for the common dialogs from Kevin Altis.  See
wxPython/lib/dialogs.py for more details.



2.3.4.2
-------
Various bug fixes.



2.3.4.1
-------
Updated XRCed and wxTimeCtrl contribs.

Show a couple new wxGrid features in the demo.

Several bug fixes in wxWindows.

Added wxHtmlFilter.

wxASSERT and related C++ runtime diagnostics are now converted to
Python exceptions.  When an assert happens a wxPyAssertionError
(which derives from AssertionError) exception is created and when
control returns back to the Python code that invoked the C++ API it
will be raised.  The same exception restrictions are in place as
before, namely that exceptions can't cross from one Python layer
through C++ to another Python layer.  That simply means that if you
want to catch wxPyAssertionError or any other exception that you need
to do it before control returns to C++ at the end of your event
handler or callback code.  There is some test code in demo/wxButton.py
you can use to play with this new feature.

Added some methods to wxApp (SetAssertMode and GetAssertMode) that let
you control how C++ assertions are processed.  Valid modes are:
wxPYAPP_ASSERT_SUPPRESS, wxPYAPP_ASSERT_EXCEPTION, and
wxPYAPP_ASSERT_DIALOG.  Using _SUPPRESS will give you behavior like
the old "final" builds and the assert will be ignored, _EXCEPTION is
the new default described above, and _DIALOG is like the default in
2.3.3.1 and prior "hybrid" builds.  You can also combine _EXCEPTION
and _DIALOG if you wish, although I don't know why you would.

You can now overload OnInitGui, OnExit and OnAssert in your classes
derived from wxApp.

Added GetSelectedCells, GetSelectionBlockTopLeft,
GetSelectionBlockBottomRight, GetSelectedRows, GetSelectedCols nethods
to wxGrid.

Added Python == and != operators for some basic classes

Fixed the Python wrappers for wxInputStream so they no longer block
when reading from a wxProcess on wxGTK.  They now work more or less as
they did before 2.3.3.1 but the dual meaning of eof() has been
removed.  There is now a CanRead() method that lets you know if there
is data waiting to be read from the pipe.

Fixed method name clash in wxIEHtmlWin, renamed Refresh to RefreshPage.

Added Throbber from Cliff Wells to the library and the demo.

Windows installer prompts to uninstall old version first.

Added wxPython.lib.evtmgr by Robb Shecter, which is an easier, more
"Pythonic" and more OO method of registering handlers for wxWindows
events using the Publish/Subscribe pattern.

Added wxPython.lib.popupctl by Gerrit van Dyk which is a combobox-like
gizmo for poping up arbitrary controls.  It is currently using
wxDialog because of some issues with wxPopupWindow...

Added wxPython.lib.gridmovers by Gerrit van Dyk which facilitates the
dragging of columns and/or rows in a wxGrid.

Added wxPython.lib.multisash by Gerrit van Dyk which is a nice
implementation of allowing the user to split a window any number of
times either horizontally or vertically, and to close the split off
windows when desired.

Added helpviewer tool that displays HTML books similarly to how MS
HTMLHelp viewer does.  Changed how the wxPythonDocs tarball is built
and added a script to launch the doc viewer.




2.3.3.1
-------
Added wxSplashScreen.

Added wxGenericDirCtrl.

Added wxMultiChoiceDialog.

The calltip window and autocomplete window in wxSTC will now use a
wxPopupWindow if available on the platform (and functioning correctly)
so they can extend beyond the client area of the STC if needed.

Finished wrapping and providing typemaps for wxInputStream and also
added the stream ctor and other methods for wxImage so images can now
be loaded from any Python "file-like" object.

Changed the img2py tool to use PNG instead of XPM for embedding image
data in Python source code, and the generated code now uses streams to
convert the image data to wxImage, wxBitmap, or wxIcon.

Added the wxPython.lib.rcsizer module which contains RowColSizer.
This sizer is based on code from Niki Spahiev and lets you specify a
row and column for each item, as well as optional column or row
spanning.  Cells with no item assigned to it are just left blank.
Stretchable rows or columns are specified and work the same as in
wxFlexGridSizer.

Updated XRCed from Roman Rolinsky

Added wxBufferedDC.

Upgraded wxSTC from Scintilla 1.40 to Scintilla 1.45, and then again
to version 1.47, and one more time to 1.48! <wink>

UNICODE!
    wxWindows/wxPython can be compiled with unicode support enabled or
    disabled.  Previous to wxPython 2.3.3 non-unicode mode was always
    used.  Starting with 2.3.3 either mode is supported, but only if
    it is also available in wxWindows on the platform.  Currently
    wxWindows only supports unicode on MS Windows platforms, but with
    the recent release of GTK+ 2.0 it is only a matter of time until
    it can be done on wxGTK (Linux and other unixes) as well.

    Unicode works best on platforms in the NT branch of the Windows
    family tree (NT, win2k, XP) but it is now also possible to use the
    same unicode binaries on win95/98/ME platforms as well!  This is
    done by using a special library and DLL with the application
    called MSLU, (Microsoft Layer for Unicode).  It simply gets out of
    the way if the app is run on an NT box, otherwise if run on a
    win9x box it loads a special DLL that provides the unicode
    versions of the windows API.  So far I have not been able to get
    this to work perfectly on win9x.  Most things work fine but
    wxTaskBarIcon for example will cause a crash if used with the
    unicode build on win95.

    So how do you use it?  It's very simple.  When unicode is enabled,
    then all functions and methods in wxPython that return a wxString
    from the C++ function will return a Python unicode object, and
    parameters to C++ functions/methods that expect a wxString can
    accept either a Python string or unicode object.  If a string
    object is passed then it will be decoded into unicode using the
    converter pointed to by wxConvCurrent, which will use the default
    system encoding.  If you need to use a string in some other
    encoding then you should convert it to unicode using the Python
    codecs first and then pass the unicode string to the wxPython
    method.

Added wxListCtrlAutoWidthMixin from Erik Westra.

Added wxIconBundle and wxTopLevelWindow.SetIcons.

Added wxLocale and wxEncodingConverter.

A little black magic...  When the C++ object (for a window or
whatever) is deleted there is no way to force the Python shadow object
to also be destroyed and clean up all references to it.  This leads to
crashes if the shadow object tries to call a method with the old C++
pointer.  The black magic I've done is to replace the __class__ in the
Python instance object with a class that raises an exception whenever
a method call (or other attribute access) is attempted.  This works
for any class that is OOR aware.

Added OOR support for wxGridCellRenderer, wxGridCellEditor,
wxGridCellAttr, wxGridCellAttrProvider, wxGridTableBase and their
derived classes.

Added wxImage.GetDataBuffer which returns an in-place edit buffer of
the image data.  (Patch #546009)

Added a sample that shows how to embed wxPython in a wxWindows C++
application.

Added wxPyWindow, wxPyPanel and wxPyControl which are just like their
wx counterparts except they allow some of the more common C++ virtual
methods to be overridden in Python derived classes.  The methods
supported are:

    DoMoveWindow
    DoSetSize
    DoSetClientSize
    DoSetVirtualSize
    DoGetSize
    DoGetClientSize
    DoGetPosition
    DoGetVirtualSize
    DoGetBestSize
    InitDialog
    TransferDataFromWindow
    TransferDataToWindow
    Validate
    AcceptsFocus
    AcceptsFocusFromKeyboard
    GetMaxSize
    AddChild
    RemoveChild

    If there are other methods that you think should be supported
    please let me know.

Changed wxGenButton to derive from wxPyControl and overload
DoGetBestSize and AcceptsFocus.

Added wxArtProvider.

Added wxCallAfter which is a helper function that registers a function
(or any callable Python object) to be called once the next time there
are no pending events.  This is useful for when you need to do
something but it can't be done during the current event handler.  The
implementation is very simple, see wxPython/wx.py.

Fixed a boatload of reference leaks.

Added a demo of using a sizer in a wxScrolledWindow, in effect
creating a ScrolledPanel.

Added a sample to the demo that shows how to use radio menu items, and
other menu stuff.

Added wxIEHtmlWin.  This is essentially the same as using IE with the
ActiveXWrapper already in the library, but it is implemented all in
C++ and therefore does not need any of the modules from win32all and
so it is less fragile in the face of changes.

Fixed the ActiveXWrapper problem.  Looks like when the win32com
modules make a "callback" that they (incorrectly, IMHO) allocate a
transient thread state structure.  Since wxPython is now saving
tstates for it's own callbacks it ended up using garbage after
win32com got rid of the temporary tstate...

Added a generic static text control to wxPython.lib.stattext.  This is
so things like Boa and PythonCard can have a static text that can
respond to mouse events and etc.

Changed the wxDateTime.Parse* methods to return an int that will be -1
on failure, and the index where parsing stopped otherwise.

Moved tools to be a Python package in wxPython.tools, added scripts to
import and launch each tool.  This will let you import and use the
tools in your own scripts or apps as needed.  On Linux and OS X the
tool scripts are installed to {prefix}/bin so you should be able to
easily launch them from the command line.  For example, PyCrust can be
started with just the "pycrust" command.

Added a sample to the demo that catches various key events and
displays the details of the event.

Added wxWizard, wxWizardPage, wxWizardPageSimple and wxPyWizardPage.

Added wxXmlResourceHandler which allows you to create custom handlers
for nonstandard class types in XRC resources.  See the demo for an
example.

Added wxPython.lib.mixins.rubberband module from Robb Shecter.

Added wxTimeCtrl from Will Sadkin.




2.3.2.1
-------
Changed (again) how the Python global interpreter lock is handled as
well as the Python thread state.  This time it works on SMP machines
without barfing and is also still compatible with Python debuggers.

Added some patches from library contributors.



2.3.2
-----
Added EVT_HELP, EVT_HELP_RANGE, EVT_DETAILED_HELP,
EVT_DETAILED_HELP_RANGE, EVT_CONTEXT_MENU, wxHelpEvent,
wxContextMenuEvent, wxContextHelp, wxContextHelpButton, wxTipWindow,
and a demo to show them in action.

Deprecated PyShell and PyShellWindow, added a snapshot of PyCrust (see
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycrust/. )

Added the new virtual list capabilities to wxListCtrl.

Added a wxSTC style editor from Riaan Booysen to the sample apps.

Added XRCed to the wxPython Tools directory, contributed by Roman
Rolinsky.

Added a new "constructor" to most of the window classes that calls the
default C++ constructor, (the one with no parameters) and also added the
corresponding  Create(...) method.  This allows you to do a 2-step
creation of windows which is sometimes required for doing things such
as setting extended style flags before the window is created, or for
passing the object to the XRC resource system to be created from the
resource.  The name of the new "constructor" is the original name of
the class with a "Pre" in it.  For example, wxPreWindow, wxPreFrame,
etc.

Updated to version 1.40 of Scintilla and updated wxStyledTextCtrl
accordingly.  While doing this update I dropped the wxLB_SORT style
from the wxListBox created for the AutoComplete functionality.  This
means that you will have to sort the keyword lists yourself, but you
are free to do case sensitive or case insensitive sorts and set the
wxSTC flag accordingly.

Updated wxColumnSorterMixin to also be able to place sort icons on the
column headers, and updated the wxListCtrl demo to show it off by
using wxColumnSorterMixin.

Added wxGenBitmapTextButton, TablePrint, etc. contribs from Lorne White.

Added wxNativeFontInfo and wxFontMapper.

Added pySketch to the samples.

Significantly changed how the Python interpreter lock and thread state
are managed, which should fix the problem of running on a
multi-processor machine.

Added wxPyLog so log targets can be created in Python to handle log
messages however is wished.  See demo/Main.py for an example.

Added wxFindReplaceDialog.

The second phase of OOR is implemented for wxEvtHandler, wxSizer,
wxShape and derived classes.  This means that functions and methods
that return an object derived from wxEvtHandler that was originally
created in Python, will return the original Python object (if it still
exists) instead of letting SWIG wrap a new shadow object around the
original C++ pointer.

Added some optimization methods to wxDC: GetBoundingBox, DrawLineList,
DrawPointList.

Added a set of sophisticated Error Dialogs from Chris Fama.

Added wxRightTextCtrl from Josu Oyanguren to wxPython.lib for aligning
text in a wxTextCtrl to the right side.

Added wxURLDataObject and an example showing drag and drop of URLs to
and from web browsers.  It's still not 100% bullet-proof for all types
of browsers, but it works for the majority of cases with the popular
browsers on Windows.  On wxGTK it seems that only Netscape 4.x works,
if anybody has any suggestions about this please bring it up on the
wx-dev list.

Added wxStopWatch.

Added wxMimeTypesManager and wxFileType.

Passing None for the handler parameter to one of the EVT_** functions
will now Disconnect the event.

Added wxPopupWindow and wxPopupTransientWindow.

Added wxFileHistory.

Added wxDynamicSashWindow, which allows you to endlessly split windows
by dragging a little tab next to the scrollbars.  Added a demo to show
this and also the ability of multiple wxStyledTextCtrls to share the
same document.

Added wxEditableListBox gizmo.

Updated wxEditor with lots of enhancements from Steve Howell and Adam
Feuer.

Added the "SplitTree gizmos" which are a collection of classes that
were designed to operate together and provide a tree control with
additional columns for each item.  The classes are
wxRemotelyScrolledTreeCtrl, wxTreeCompanionWindow,
wxThinSplitterWindow, and wxSplitterScrolledWindow, some of which may
also be useful by themselves.

Added wxDllWidget from Vaclav Slavik which allows wx widgets derived
from wxWindow to be loaded from a C++ .dll (or .so) and be used in a
wxPython program, without the widget having to be SWIGged first.  The
visible API of the widget is limited to wxWindow methods plus a
SendCommand method, but it is still quite powerful.  See
wxPython/contrib/dllwidget and wxPython/demo/dllwidget for more
details.




2.3.1
-----
Added EVT_GRID_EDITOR_CREATED and wxGridEditorCreatedEvent so the user
code can get access to the edit control when it is created, (to push
on a custom event handler for example.)

Added wxTextAttr class and SetStyle, SetDefaultStyle and
GetDefaultStyle methods to wxTextCtrl.

Added ability to use xml resource files.  Still need to add ability to
subclass wxXmlResourceHandler, etc...

Added wxGridAutoEditMixin to the mixins library package.

Made ColourSelect be derived from wxButton.

Fixed img2py to work correctly with Python 2.1.

Added enhanced wxVTKRenderWindow by Prabhu Ramachandran



2.3.0
-----
Removed initial startup dependency on the OpenGL DLLs so only the
glcanvasc.pyd depends on them, (on wxMSW.)

Changed wxFont, wxPen, wxBrush to not implicitly use the
wxThe[Font|Pen|Brush]List objects behind the scenes, but to use normal
ctor and dtors.

Exposed the wxThe[Font|Pen|Brush]List to wxPython.

Also added wxTheColourDatabase and added a library module (in the
wxPython.lib.colourdb module) to load LOTS more colour names into the
colour database.

Added wxWakeUpMainThread, wxMutexGuiEnter, wxMutexGuiLeave,
wxMutexGuiLocker and wxThread_IsMain to assist with dealing with GUI
access from non-GUI threads.

wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow is now (more) thread safe if non-GUI threads
use print, sys.stdout.write, etc.

Added CreateTextSizer and CreateButtonSizer to wxDialog

Added wxPython/lib/infoframe.py from Chris Fama.  It contains a class
that can be used in place of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow.

Added colourselect.py, imagebrowser.py and an updated calendar.py to
wxPython/lib from Lorne White.

Added patch to wxPoint_LIST_helper from Tim Hochberg that should make
it gobs faster in certain situations.

Added tools that will take an image file in a wx supported format and
convert it to data embedded in a Python source file.  The image is
converted to XPM format which is essentially a list of strings
containing info about each pixel.  The image's transparency mask is
included, if there is one, or a mask can be added if a mask colour is
specified on the command line.  It is then pickled and optionally
compressed and written to a Python source file along with functions to
convert it to either a wxBitmap or a wxImage.  See
wxPython/demo/images.py for examples, and wxPython/Tools/img2py.py for
the implementation.

Fixed wxStyledTextCtrl to be much faster on wxGTK.  There was some
experimental code that got left in place that ended up causing way too
many refreshes.

A couple more hacks in my_distutils.py so wxPython can be built with
the distutils that comes with Python 2.1.

Added a ton of missing methods for wxPrintData.

Switched to InnoSetup for MSW distributions.

Added wxToggleButton.

Fixed bug that prevented wxTreeCtrl.OnCompareItems from being called.

Added some methods to wxGrid:
      GetCellHighlightPenWidth
      GetCellHighlightROPenWidth
      SetCellHighlightPenWidth
      SetCellHighlightROPenWidth
      GetGridWindow
      GetGridRowLabelWindow
      GetGridColLabelWindow
      GetGridCornerLabelWindow

Added wxGetClientDisplayRect which on wxMSW returns a wxRect
representing the area on screen not occupied by the taskbar and such.
On other platforms it is equivallent to wxGetDisplaySize.

OOR:
   Implemented the first phase of OOR (Original Object Return).  See
   the text in the demo for more details of what this means, but in a
   nutshell methods such as wxWindow.GetParent or FindWindowById will
   now return a shadow object of the proper type if it can.  By
   "proper type" I mean that if the wxWindow pointer returned from
   FindWindowById really points to a wxButton then the Python object
   constructed will be of a wxButtonPtr class instead of wxWindowPtr
   as before.  This should reduce or eliminiate the need for
   wxPyTypeCast.  (Woo Hoo!)  The objects returned are still not the
   original Python object, but that is the next step.  (Although it
   will probably only work on Python 2.1 and beyond because it will
   use weak references.)

   This first phase of the OOR plan is fairly significant and has
   required a lot of changes all over wxPython, most of which should
   be transparent to you, however I'm not 100% sure that it didn't
   introduce any new bugs that are hiding somewhere and didn't get
   stomped on during my testing.  So please be sure to test everything
   thoroughly when you install this version and be sure to report any
   object-type related oddities to me.


There is now a wxObject class that most other classes derive from like
in C++, but the methods provided don't really match but are wxPython
specific.  It could have been added long ago but OOR required it so it
finally got done.

Finally added wxPyLineShape.GetLineControlPoints, which has been on my
list for a while.  The above OOR modification made this easier.

Fixed the __cmp__ methods for wxPoint and others.

Added wxWave.

Added the wxPython.lib.mixins package to the library, it is where
useful mix-in classes can be placed.  Currently there is one to help
make the columns in a wxListCtrl sortable, and the MagicIMageList from
Mike Fletcher.  If you have any custom code that can be factored out
of existing classes into a mix-in that would be useful to others
please send it to me for inclusion in this package.

Added a few little sample applications to help newbies to get started
by having smaller functional apps to play with.  They can be found in
wxPython/samples.




2.2.6
-----

No changes happened in the Python wrappers for this release, only
changes and fixes in the wxWindows library.



2.2.5
-----

New typemaps for wxString when compiling for Python 2.0 and beyond
that allow Unicode objects to be passed as well as String objects.  If
a Unicode object is passed PyString_AsStringAndSize is used to convert
it to a wxString using the default encoding.

Fixed the generic buttons so tool tips work for them.

Fixed a bug in the demo's tree control.

Added a listbox to the listbox demo that shows how to find items with
a matching prefix as keys are typed.

Added code to the wxListCtrl demo to show how to get text from a
column in report mode.

Added code to the toolbar demo to clear the long help from the status
bar after 2 seconds.

Added wxJoystick.

Fixed wxTimer so it can be used as described in the docs, either with
a Notify method in a subclass, or sending an event to a wxEvtHandler
object, (usually a window.)

Added wxNotifyEvent.Allow()

Fixed GOBS of reference leaks.

Massive code changes and cleanup to allow wxPython to be split into
multiple extension modules again.  A Python CObject is used to allow
the "export" of SWIG functions and other common helper functions from
the wxc module to other modules, even if they are in separate shared
libraries.  Should also be usable from 3rd party code, just include
wxPython/src/export.h

Changed the default setup so the following are built as separate
extension modules:  calendar, glcanvas, grid, html, ogl, stc, and
utils.  Will probably add more later.

Changed the wxPrinterDC to use the new constructor taking a
wxPrintData object.  The old ctor is still there using the
wxPrinterDC2 name.

Added wxPython.lib.anchors.py from Riaan Booysen.  It contains a class
that implements Delphi's Anchors with wxLayoutConstraints.

Added wxPython.lib.fancytext from Timothy Hochberg.

Changed the GenericButtons to send their event in idle time, so the
mouse won't be captured when the event handler is called.

Added wxPython.lib.rpcMixin from Greg Landrum, although it's not
integrated with the demo yet.  It allows a wxPython GUI to be an
XML-RPC server.



New in 2.2.2
------------

Significantly changed how the wxStyledtextCtrl code that wraps
Scintilla is implemented.  Most of it is now automatically generated
from an interface definition file provided by Scintilla.  This means
that it will be much easier to stay in sync with new Scintilla
releases, but also means that some of the method and identifier names
have changed.  See wxPython/demo/data/stc.h for a copy of the C++
interface from which the Python interface is generated.  There is now
some inline documentation in that file that should really help explain
how things work.

I am now using the Python Distutils to build wxPython and to make some
of the distribution files.  (See http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/)
This means no more messing with my kludgy build.py/Makefile hack,
builds will be more consistent with other Python extensions that also
use Distutils, and will hopefully make wxPython easier to build for
platforms where there have been troubles before.  If you are building
wxPython for Python 1.5.2 or for 1.6, then you will need to get and
install version 1.0 of Distutils from the website above.  If you are
using Python 2.0 then you already have it.

Added wxInputStream and the wxFileSystem family of classes,
contributed by Joerg Baumann.

Added wxProcess and support for it to wxExecute.  wxProcess lets you
get notified when an asyncronous child process terminates, and also to
get input/output streams for the child process's stdout, stderr and
stdin.

Removed the old python sizers.

Added __add__, __sub__ and __cmp__ (equality check only) for wxPoint
and wxRealPoint.

Changed the build to make one big extension module instead of one for
the core and each contrib.  This allowed me to do away with the
libwxPyHelpers.so on unix systems.

Lots of little fixes here and there.

Some hacks on wxGTK to try and make the AutoComplete listbox in the
wxStyledTextCtrl to behave better.  It's still not as nice as on
wxMSW, but at least it's a bit more usable now.




New in 2.2.1
------------

Various tweaks, fixes, missing methods, etc.

Added example use of wxTaskBarIcon to the demo.



New in 2.2.0
------------

Added wxLog and friends.

Added wxFrame.ShowFullScreen for MSW.

Added PyShellWindow to the wxPython.lib package.



New in 2.1.16
-------------

Added an attribute named labelDelta to the generic buttons that
specifies how far to offset the label when the button is in the
depressed state.

Added wxTipProvider and friends.  See the demo for an example.

wxGrid can now change the cell highlight colour.

Added wxDragImage.

Fixed printing on wxGTK.

Added wxDateTime, wxTimeSpan, and wxDateSpan to wxPython.utils.

Added wxCalendarCtrl.

WARNING: A while back I asked what should be done about the Magic
Method Names.  (Methods that are automatically turned into event
handlers by virtue of their name.)  The consensus was that it is more
confusing to have them than to try and expand them to have greater
coverage.  I am finally getting around to removing the code that
generates the event binding.  This means that if you are using any of
the following method names without a EVT_* call that you need to
modify your code to add the EVT_* to hook the event to the method.

    OnChar
    OnSize
    OnEraseBackground
    OnSysColourChanged
    OnInitDialog
    OnPaint
    OnIdle
    OnActivate
    OnMenuHighlight
    OnCloseWindow
    OnScroll

Added wxSpinCtrl.




New in 2.1.15
-------------

Fixed wxTreeCtrl.HitTest to return both the tree item as well as the
flags that clairify where the click was in relation to the item.

Fixed thread state problem in wxTreeCtrl.GetBoundingBox and
GetSelections.

Fixed some problems in OGL.  Also wxShape.SetClientData and
.GetClientData can now deal with Python objects.

Added wxListCtrl.SortItems and changed the demo to show how to use it.

Plugged a memory leak.

Wrapped the new wxGrid and friends.  The old wxGrid class is no longer
available.  There are some incompatibilities, and unfortunately the
new classes are not documented yet, (however the methods are more
consistent with each other now so you may be able to guess pretty
good...)

Updated filebrowsebutton.py and calendar.py with changes from their
authors.  There is now a FileBrowseButtonWithHistory class (what a
mouthful!) and wxCalendar has printing support.

Added ActiveXWrapper to the library, and some good demos of it too.
It works great for embedding a COM (a.k.a OCX, a.k.a ActiveX) control
in a window and calling its methods.  It actually creates a new class
on the fly that derives from wxWindow, the COM CoClass and others
needed to make it all work.  The resulting class can be instantiated
just like wxWindow, used in sizers, etc.  It also responds to all COM
method calls, properties, etc., and if the class or a mix-in has
matching method names, then the COM events will be propogated back to
them.

Created a typemap that allows a string to be used for parameters
expecting a wxColour type.  The string is either a colour name as
defined in the wxColourDatabase, or a colour spec of the form
"#RRGGBB".  See the wxStyledTextCtrl demo for an example.

I almost forgot to mention the wxStyledTextCtrl!  Yes, the
wxStyledTextCtrl is finally in wxPython!!  (And the crowd goes
wild...)   There's no documentaTion yet (the crowd boos and hisses...)
but I've included a very readable source file in the
wxPython/demo/data directory, a couple fairly good examples, and you
can also refer to the Scintilla documentaion at
http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html to help fill in the gaps
until the docs are done.  (The croud murmers contentedly as the tool
provider smiles convincingly and removes his flame-proof suit.)




What's new in 2.1.13
--------------------
Skipped a version number to match what has been released for wxGTK.

Updated wxMVCTree and added a demo for it, also fixed layout on GTK
and some flicker problems.

Added a wrapper class for the Visualization ToolKit (or VTK) in the
wxPython.lib.vtk module.  (http://www.kitware.com/)

Fixed wxTreeCtrl.SetItemImage and GetItemImage to recognise the new
"which" parameter.

Added wxPython.lib.spashscreen from Mike Fletcher.

Added wxPython.lib.filebrowsebutton also from Mike Fletcher.

Renamed wxTreeCtrl.GetParent to GetItemParent to avoid a name clash
with wxWindow.GetParent.

Added wxIntersectRect to compute the intersection of two wxRect's.
It is used like this:

   intersect = wxIntersectRect(rect1, rect2)

If r1 and r2 don't intersect then None is returned, otherwise the
rectangle representing the intersection is returned.

Some bug fixes for Clipboard and Drag-n-Drop.

Rotated text!!!  WooHoo!  (See wxDC.DrawRotatedText())

Added a set of Generic Buttons to the library.  These are simple
window classes that look and act like native buttons, but you can have
a bit more control over them.  The bezel width can be set in addition
to colours, fonts, etc.  There is a ToggleButton as well as Bitmap
versions too.  They should also serve as a good example of how to
create your own classes derived from wxControl.

The C++ wxToolBar classes have been redone, and so have the wxPython
wrappers.  There have been slight modifications to some of the methods
but shouldn't impact anybody too much.  I took the opportunity to add
support for setting user data on each toolbar tool.  The new AddTool
methods look like this:

        def AddTool(ID,
                    bitmap,
                    pushedBitmap = wxNullBitmap,
                    toggle = FALSE,
                    clientData = NULL,
                    shortHelpString = "",
                    longHelpString = "")

        def AddSimpleTool(ID,
                          bitmap,
                          shortHelpString = "",
                          longHelpString = "",
                          toggle=FALSE)


There are also corresponding InsertTool and InsertSimpleTool methods
that additionally take an integer position as the first parameter.

Added a wrapper for the new PCX and TIFF ImageHandlers.

wxRect now simulates attributes named left, right, top and bottom.

Removed all non wx stuff from the glcanvas module since DA's PyOpenGL
is better and compatible with the wxGLCanvas.  You can get it at
http://starship.python.net:9673/crew/da/Code/PyOpenGL.

Added some missing EVT functions.

Added Dirk Holtwic's editor classes to the wxPython.lib.editor
package.

Changed all the "LIST" parameter names to "choices" to match the docs.

More fixes for the wxFloatBar, and it now works on wxGTK even better
than wxMSW!  (The feat is accomplished by using the wxTB_DOCKABLE
style flag instead of trying to float it ourselves.)




What's new in 2.1.11
--------------------
Skipped a few version numbers so wxMSW, wxGTK and wxPython are all
syncronized.

wxImage.SetData now makes a copy of the image data before giving it to
wxImage.  I mistakenly thought that wxImage would copy the data
itself.

Fixed wxMSW's notebook so the pages get their size set as they are
being added.  This should remove the need for our
wxNotebook.ResizeChildren hack.

wxPanels now support AutoLayout, and wxNotebooks and wxSplitterWindows
no longer tell their children to Layout() themselves.  This will
probably only effect you if you have a wxWindow with AutoLayout inside
a notebook or splitter.  If so, either change it to a wxPanel or add
an EVT_SIZE handler that calls Layout().

Fixed deadlock problem that happened when using threads.

Added new HTML printing classes.

Added wxWindow.GetHandle

Apparently wxMouseEvent.Position has been depreciated in wxWindows as
it is no longer available by default.  You can use GetPositionTuple
(returning a tuple with x,y) instead, or GetPosition (returning a
wxPoint.)

Added wxPostEvent function that allows events to be posted and then
processed later.  This is a thread-safe way to interact with the GUI
thread from other threads.

Added Clipboard and Drag-and-Drop classes.

Added wxFontEnumerator.

Many updates to wxMenu, wxMenuBar.

wxPyEvent and wxPyCommandEvent derived classes now give you the actual
Python object in the event handler instead of a new shadow.

Added a Calendar widget from Lorne White to the library.

Made some fixes to the wxFloatbar.  It still has some troubles on
wxGTK...

Added an MVC tree control from Bryn Keller to the library.




What's new in 2.1.5
-------------------
This is a quick bug-fix release to take care of a few nasties that
crept in at the last minute before 2.1.4 was called done.  No new
major features.



What's new in 2.1.4
--------------------

This release is NOT syncronized with a snapshot release of wxGTK or
wxMSW.  For MSW this isn't much of a problem since you can get the
binaries from the web site.  For other platforms you'll have to build
wxGTK from CVS.  (See http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/cvs.htm)
To get the same set of sources from CVS that I used, checkout using
the wxPy-2-1-4 tag.

Now back to what's new...

Much more support for event-less callbacks and add-on modules.

Created add-on module with wxOGL classes.

Added wxWindow.GetChildren().  Be careful of this.  It returns a *copy*
of the list of the window's children.  While you are using the list if
anything changes in the real list (a child is deleted, etc.) then the
list you are holding will suddenly have window references to garbage
memory and your app will likely crash.  But if you are careful it works
great!

Added a bunch of new and missing methods to wxTreeCrtl.  The
SortChildren method is now supported, but currently only for the
default sort order.

Added typemaps for wxSize, wxPoint, wxRealPoint, and wxRect that allow
either the actual objects or Python sequence values to be used.  For
example, the following are equivallent:

    win = wxWindow(parent, size = wxSize(100, 100))
    win = wxWindow(parent, size = (100, 100))

Super-charged the wxHtml module.  You can now create your own tag
handlers and also have access to the parser and cell classes.  There
is a tag handler in the library at wxPython.lib.wxpTag that
understands the WXP tag and is able to place wxPython windows on HTML
pages.  See the demo for an example.

A bunch of the methods of wxMenuBar were previously ifdef'd out for
wxGTK.  Added them back in since the methods exist now.

Wrapped the wxHtmlHelpController and related classes.

Wrapped the C++ versions of wxSizer and friends.  The Python-only
versions are still in the library, but depreciated.  (You will get a
warning message if you try to use them, but the warning can be
disabled.) The usage of the C++ versions is slightly different, and
the functionality of wxBorderSizer is now part of wxBoxSizer.  I have
added a few methods to wxSizer to try and make the transition as
smooth as possible, I combined all Add methods into a single method
that handles all cases, added an AddMany method, etc.  One step I did
not take was to make the default value of flag in the Add method be
wxGROW.  This would have made it more backward compatible, but less
portable to and from wxWin C++ code.  Please see the docs and demo for
further details.

Added wxPyEvent and wxPyCommandEvent classes, derived from wxEvent and
wxCommandEvent.  Each of them has SetPyData and GetPyData methods that
accept or return a single Python object.  You can use these classes
directly or derive from them to create your own types of event objects
that can pass through the wxWindows event system without loosing their
Python parts (as long as they are stored with SetPyData.)  Stay tuned
for more info and examples in future releases.

Added wxPython.lib.grids as an example of how to derive a new sizer
from the C++ sizers.  In this module you will find wxGridSizer and
wxFlexGridSizer.  wxGridSizer arrainges its items in a grid in which
all the widths and heights are the same.  wxFlexgridSizer allows
different widths and heights, and you can also specify rows and/or
columns that are growable.  See the demo for a couple examples for how
to use them.

Added the wxValidator class, and created a class named wxPyValidator
that should be used for the base class of any Python validators.  See
the demo for an example.  Please note that you MUST implement a Clone
method in your validator classes because of the way some things work
in the underlying C++ library.  I did not add wxTextValidator because
of some issues of how it transfers data to and from a wxString, which
in wxPython is automatically translated to and from Python strings, so
there would never be a concrete wxString that would hang around long
enough for the validator to do its job.  On the other hand, it should
be real easy to duplicate the functionality of wxTextValidator in a
pure Python class derived from wxPyValidator.

I've finally added a feature that has been on my list for close to two
years!  Ever wondered what that zero is for when you create your app
object?  Well now you can leave it out or explicitly set it to a true
value.  This value now controls what is to be done with sys.stdout and
sys.stderr.  A false value leaves them alone, and a true value sets
them to an instance of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow.  (On windows the
default is true, on unix platforms the default is false.)  This class
creates a frame containing a wxTextCtrl as soon as anything is written
to sys.stdout or sys.stderr.  If you close the window it will come
back again the next time something is written.  (You can call
app.RestoreStdio to turn this off.)  If you would rather that the stdio be
redirected to a file, you can provide a second parameter to your app
object's constructor that is a filename.  If you want to use your own
class instead of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow you can either implement
RedirectStdio() in you app class or change the value of
wxApp.outputWindowClass like this:

    class MyApp(wxApp):
        outputWindowClass = MyClass

        def OnInit(self):
            frame = MyFrame()
            self.SetTopWindow(frame)
            return true

Please see the implementation of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow and wxApp in
wx.py for more details.  A few words of caution:  if you are running
your app in a debugger, changing sys.stdout and sys.stderr is likely
to really screw things up.

Added wxCaret.  Unfortunately it's author has still not documented it
in the wxWindows docs...

Some new 3rd party contributions in wxPython.lib.  PyShell, in
shell.py is an interesting implementaion of an interactive Python
shell in wxWindows.  floatbar.py has a class derived from wxToolBar
that can sense mouse drags and then reparent itself into another
frame. Moving the new frame close to where it came from puts the tool
bar back into the original parent.  (Unfortunately there is currently
a bug in wxGTK's wxFrame.SetToolBar so the FloatBar has some
problems...)




What's new in 2.1b3
--------------------

This release is syncronized with release 2.1 snapshot 9 of wxWindows.

Switched to using SWIG from CVS (see http://swig.cs.uchicago.edu/cvs.html)
for some of the new features and such.  Also they have encorporated my
patches so there is really no reason to stick with the current (very
old) release...  This version of SWIG gives the following new
features:

    1. Keyword arguments.  You no longer have to specify all the
       parameters with defaults to a method just to specify a
       non-default value on the end.  You can now do this instead:

          win = wxWindow(parent, -1, style = mystyle)

    2. There is now an an equivalence between Python's None and C++'s
       NULL.  This means that any methods that might return NULL will
       now return None and you can use none where wxWindows might be
       expecting NULL.  This makes things much more snake-ish.


There is a new build system based on a new Python program instead of
raw makefiles.  Now wxPython builds are virtually the same on MSW or
Unix systems.  See the end of this file for new build instructions and
see distrib/build.py for more details.

wxDC.Bilt now includes the useMask parameter, and has been split into
two different versions.  wxDC.BlitXY is like what was there before and
takes raw coordinants and sizes, and the new wxDC.Blit is for the new
interface using wxPoints and a wxSize.





What's new in 2.1b2
--------------------

Added the missing wxWindow.GetUpdateRegion() method.

Made a new change in SWIG (update your patches everybody) that
provides a fix for global shadow objects that get an exception in
their __del__ when their extension module has already been deleted.
It was only a 1 line change in .../SWIG/Modules/pycpp.cxx at about
line 496 if you want to do it by hand.

It is now possible to run through MainLoop more than once in any one
process.  The cleanup that used to happen as MainLoop completed (and
prevented it from running again) has been delayed until the wxc module
is being unloaded by Python.

I fixed a bunch of stuff in the C++ version of wxGrid so it wouldn't
make wxPython look bad.

wxWindow.PopupMenu() now takes a wxPoint instead of  x,y.  Added
wxWindow.PopupMenuXY to be consistent with some other methods.

Added wxGrid.SetEditInPlace and wxGrid.GetEditInPlace.

You can now provide your own app.MainLoop method.  See
wxPython/demo/demoMainLoop.py for an example and some explaination.

Got the in-place-edit for the wxTreeCtrl fixed and added some demo
code to show how to use it.

Put the wxIcon constructor back in for GTK as it now has one that
matches MSW's.

Added wxGrid.GetCells

Added wxSystemSettings static methods as functions with names like
wxSystemSettings_GetSystemColour.

Removed wxPyMenu since using menu callbacks have been depreciated in
wxWindows.  Use wxMenu and events instead.

Added alternate wxBitmap constructor (for MSW only) as
      wxBitmapFromData(data, type, width, height, depth = 1)

Added a helper function named wxPyTypeCast that can convert shadow
objects of one type into shadow objects of another type.  (Like doing
a down-cast.)  See the implementation in wx.py for some docs.

Fixed wxImage GetData and SetData to properly use String objects for
data transfer.

Added access methods to wxGridEvent.

New Makefile/Setup files supporting multiple dynamic extension modules
for unix systems.

Fixes for the wxGLCanvas demo to work around a strange bug in gtk.

SWIG support routines now compiled separately instead of being bundled
in wx.cpp.





What's new in 2.1b1
--------------------
Fixed wxComboBox.SetSelection so that it actually sets the selected
item.  (Actually just removed it from wxPython and let it default to
wxChoice.SetSelection which was already doing the right thing.)

Added the Printing Framework.

Switched back to using the wxWindows DLL for the pre-built Win32
version.  The problem was needing to reinitialize static class info
data after loading each extension module.

Lots of little tweaks and additions to reflect changes to various
wxWindows classes.

Fixed a bug with attaching objects to tree items.  Actually was a
symptom of a larger problem with not obtaining the interpreter lock
when doing any Py_DECREFs.

wxSizer and friends.  Sizers are layout tools that manage a colection
of windows and sizers.  Different types of sizers apply different
types of layout algorithms.  You saw it here first!  These classes are
not even in the wxWindows C++ library yet!



What's new in 2.0b9
-------------------
Bug fix for ListCtrl in test4.py (Was a missing file...  DSM!)

Bug fix for occassional GPF on Win32 systems upon termination of a
wxPython application.

Added wxListBox.GetSelections returning selections as a Tuple.

Added a wxTreeItemData that is able to hold any Python object and be
associated with items in a wxTreeCtrl.  Added test pytree.py to show
this feature off.

Added wxSafeYield function.

OpenGL Canvas can be optionally compiled in to wxPython.

Awesome new Demo Framework for showing off wxPython and for learning
how it all works.

The pre-built Win32 version is no longer distributing the wxWindows
DLL.  It is statically linked with the wxWindows library instead.

Added a couple missing items from the docs.

Added wxImage, wxImageHandler, wxPNGHandler, wxJPEGHandler,
wxGIFHandler and wxBMPHandler.

Added new methods to wxTextCtrl.

Fixed some problems with how SWIG was wrapping some wxTreeCtrl
methods.



What's new in 2.0b8
-------------------
Support for using Python threads in wxPython apps.

Several missing methods from various classes.

Various bug fixes.



What's new in 2.0b7
-------------------
Added DLG_PNT and DLG_SZE convienience methods to wxWindow class.

Added missing constructor and other methods for wxMenuItem.



What's new in 2.0b6
-------------------
Just a quickie update to fix the self-installer to be compatible with
Python 1.5.2b2's Registry settings.


What's new in 2.0b5
-------------------
Well obviously the numbering scheme has changed.  I did this to
reflect the fact that this truly is the second major revision of
wxPython, (well the third actually if you count the one I did for
wxWindows 1.68 and then threw away...) and also that it is associated
with the 2.0 version of wxWindows.

I have finally started documenting wxPython.  There are several pages
in the wxWindows documentation tree specifically about wxPython, and I
have added notes within the class references about where and how wxPython
diverges from wxWindows.

Added wxWindow_FromHWND(hWnd) for wxMSW to construct a wxWindow from a
window handle.  If you can get the window handle into the python code,
it should just work...  More news on this later.

Added wxImageList, wxToolTip.

Re-enabled wxConfig.DeleteAll() since it is reportedly fixed for the
wxRegConfig class.

As usual, some bug fixes, tweaks, etc.



What's new in 0.5.3
-------------------
Added wxSashWindow, wxSashEvent, wxLayoutAlgorithm, etc.

Various cleanup, tweaks, minor additions, etc. to maintain
compatibility with the current wxWindows.



What's new in 0.5.0
-------------------
Changed the import semantics from ``"from wxPython import *"`` to 
``"from wxPython.wx import *"``  This is for people who are worried about
namespace pollution, they can use "from wxPython import wx" and then
prefix all the wxPython identifiers with "wx."

Added wxTaskbarIcon for wxMSW.

Made the events work for wxGrid.

Added wxConfig.

Added wxMiniFrame for wxGTK.

Changed many of the args and return values that were pointers to gdi
objects to references to reflect changes in the wxWindows API.

Other assorted fixes and additions.




What's new in 0.4.2
-------------------

wxPython on wxGTK works!!!  Both dynamic and static on Linux and
static on Solaris have been tested.  Many thanks go to Harm
<H.v.d.Heijden@phys.tue.nl> for his astute detective work on tracking
down a nasty DECREF bug.  Okay so I have to confess that it was just a
DSM (Dumb Stupid Mistake) on my part but it was nasty none the less
because the behavior was so different on different platforms.

The dynamicly loaded module on Solaris is still segfaulting, so it
must have been a different issue all along...



What's New in 0.4
-----------------

1. Worked on wxGTK compatibility.  It is partially working.  On a
Solaris/Sparc box wxPython is working but only when it is statically
linked with the Python interpreter.  When built as a dyamically loaded
extension module, things start acting weirdly and it soon seg-faults.
And on Linux both the statically linked and the dynamically linked
version segfault shortly after starting up.

2. Added Toolbar, StatusBar and SplitterWindow classes.

3. Varioius bug fixes, enhancements, etc.
