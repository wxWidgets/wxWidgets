<div class="section">
<h1><a id="id1" name="id1">2.8.1.0</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>8-Jan-2006</li>
</ul>
<p>Added EVT_TASKBAR_CLICK and use it to show taskbar icon menu on right
button release, not press, under MSW (bug 1623761)</p>
<p>Added wxTreeCtrl::CollapseAll[Children]() and IsEmpty() methods;
documented wxTreeItemId (patch 1622125)</p>
<p>Fix wxMDIChidFrame::GetPosition() (patch 1626610)</p>
<p>Fix attribute memory leak in wxGrid::ShowCellEditControl() (patch
1629949)</p>
<p>wxGTK: Fix for controls on a toolbar being the full height of the
toolbar instead of their natural height.</p>
<p>wx.lib.customtreectrl patches from Andrea Gavana.</p>
<p>wxMac: Applied patch #1622389, fixing two memory leaks in
GetPartialTextExtents.</p>
<p>More fixes for the native wx.ListCtrl on Mac.</p>
<p>Added wx.aui.AuiNotebook.GetAuiManager().</p>
<p>Added wx.aui.AuiMDIParentFrame and wx.aui.AuiMDIChildFrame, which
essentially implement the MDI interface using a normal wx.Frame and a
wx.aui.AuiNotebook.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="id2" name="id2">2.8.0.1</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>11-Dec-2006</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of fixes and updates to the AUI classes.</p>
<p>Added wx.CollapsiblePane.  On wxGTK it uses a native expander widget,
on the other platforms a regular button is used to control the
collapsed/expanded state.</p>
<p>Added the wx.combo module, which contains the ComboCtrl and ComboPopup
classes.  These classes allow you to implement a wx.ComboBox-like
widget where the popup can be nearly any kind of widget, and where you
have a lot of control over other aspects of the combo widget as well.
It works very well on GTK and MSW, using native renderers for drawing
the combo button, but is unfortunatly still a bit klunky on OSX...</p>
<p>Use system default paper size for printing instead of A4 by default.</p>
<p>Added wx.combo.OwnerDrawnComboBox, which is a ComboCtrl that delegates
the drawing of the items in the popup and in the control itself to
overridden methods of a derived class, similarly to how wx.VListBox
works.</p>
<p>Added wx.combo.BitmapComboBox which is a combobox that displays a
bitmap in front of the list items.</p>
<p>Added the wx.lib.mixins.inspect module.  It contains the InspectMixin
class which can be mixed with a wx.App class and provides a PyCrust
window that can be activated with a Ctrl-Alt-I keystroke (or Cmd-Alt-I
on the Mac.)</p>
<p>Added some modules from Riaan Booysen:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>wx.lib.flagart:  contains icons of the flags of many countries.</li>
<li>wx.lib.art.img2pyartprov: makes images embedded in a python file
with img2py available via the wx.ArtProvider.</li>
<li>wx.lib.langlistctrl: A wx.ListCtrl for selecting a language,
which uses the country flag icons.</li>
<li>An I18N sample for the demo.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>wx.lib.masked: Patch from Will Sadkin.  Includes Unicode fixes, plus
more helpful exceptions and ability to designate fields in mask
without intervening fixed characters.</p>
<p>Added wx.SearchCtrl, which is a composite of a wx.TextCtrl with optional
bitmap buttons and a drop-down menu.  Controls like this can typically
be found on a toolbar of applications that support some form of search
functionality.  On the Mac this control is implemented using the
native HISearchField control, on the other platforms a generic control
is used, although that may change in the future as more platforms
introduce native search widgets.</p>
<p>Added a set of button classes to wx.lib.buttons from David Hughes that
uses the native renderer to draw the button.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="id3" name="id3">2.7.2.0</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>7-Nov-2006</li>
</ul>
<p>Patch [ 1583183 ] Fixes printing/print preview inconsistencies</p>
<p>Add events API to wxHtmlWindow (patch #1504493 by Francesco Montorsi)</p>
<p>Added wxTB_RIGHT style for right-aligned toolbars (Igor Korot)</p>
<p>Added New Zealand NZST and NZDT timezone support to wx.DateTime.</p>
<p>wx.Window.GetAdjustedBestSize is deprecated.  In every conceivable
scenario GetEffectiveMinSize is probably what you want to use instead.</p>
<p>wx.Image: Gained support for TGA image file format.</p>
<p>wx.aui: The classes in the wx.aui module have been renamed to be more
consistent with each other, and make it easier to recognize in the
docs and etc. that they belong together.</p>
<blockquote>
FrameManager --&gt;       AuiManager
FrameManagerEvent --&gt;  AuiManagerEvent
PaneInfo --&gt;           AuiPaneInfo
FloatingPane --&gt;       AuiFloatingPane
DockArt --&gt;            AuiDockArt
TabArt --&gt;             AuiTabArt
AuiMultiNotebook --&gt;   AuiNotebook
AuiNotebookEvent --&gt;   AuiNotebookEvent</blockquote>
<p>wx.lib.customtreectrl: A patch from Frank Niessink which adds an
additional style (TR_AUTO_CHECK_PARENT) that (un)checks a parent when
all children are (un)checked.</p>
<p>wx.animate.AnimationCtrl fixed to display inactive bitmap at start
(patch 1590192)</p>
<p>Patch from Dj Gilcrease adding the FNB_HIDE_ON_SINGLE_TAB style flag
for wx.lib.flatnotebook.</p>
<p>wx.Window.GetBestFittingSize has been renamed to GetEffectiveMinSize.
SetBestFittingSize has been renamed to SetInitialSize, since it is
most often used only to set the initial (and minimal) size of a
widget.</p>
<p>The QuickTime backend for wx.media.MediaCtrl on MS Windows works
again.  Just pass szBackend=wx.media.MEDIABACKEND_QUICKTIME to the
constructor to use it instead of the default ActiveMovie backend,
(assuming the quicktime DLLs are available on the system.)</p>

<div class="section">
<h1><a id="id4" name="id4">2.7.1.3</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>26-Oct-2006</li>
</ul>
<p>wxGTK:  The wx.ALWAYS_SHOW_SB style is now supported.</p>
<p>Fixed name errors in the old wxPython package namespace.  As a
reminder, use of this package is deprecated and you are encouraged to
switch your programs over to the wx package.</p>
<p>Fixed wx.glcanvas.GLCanvas.SetCurrent to be compatible with prevoius
versons.</p>
<p>Added wx.StandardPaths.GetTmpDir.</p>
<p>Bug fixes in the wx.ListCtrl on Mac from Kevin Olivier, allowing it to
send events properly again.  There is also a new native implementation
of wx.ListCtrl available, which will be used for wx.LC_REPORT style
list controls if you set the &quot;mac.listctrl.always_use_generic&quot;
SystemOption to zero.  In a future release this will be the default.</p>
<p>Added a sample to the demo that shows some of what can be done with
the new wx.GraphicsContext and wx.GraphicsPath classes.</p>

<div class="section">
<h1><a id="id5" name="id5">2.7.1.2</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>21-Oct-2006</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed a bug in the MaskedEdit controls caused by conflicting IsEmpty
methods.</p>
<p>Patch #1579280: Some mimetype optimizations on unix-like systems.</p>
<p>wxMac: Several wx.webkit.WebKitCtrl enhancements/fixes, including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>new methods for increasing/decreasing text size, getting
selection, getting/setting scroll position, printing, enabling
editing, and running JavaScripts on the page.</li>
<li>added new event (wx.webkit.WebKitBeforeLoadEvent) for catching, and
possibly vetoing, load events before they occur.</li>
<li>wx.webkit.WebKitCtrl now fires mouse events for certain events
that it was eating before. This improves wxSplitterWindow
resizing behavior.</li>
<li>refactoring of the sizing logic to move the Cocoa view.  Tested
with splitter windows, panels, notebooks and all position
correctly with this.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some improvements to the drawing code in CustomTreeCtrl.</p>
<p>Fixed refcount leak in wx.Window.GetChildren.</p>

<p>The following deprecated items have been removed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>wx.Bitmap SetQuality and GetQuality methods</li>
<li>The wx.GetNumberFromUser function</li>
<li>wx.EVT_LIST_GET_INFO and wx.EVT_LIST_SET_INFO</li>

<li>wx.html.HtmlSearchStatus.GetContentsItem method</li>
<li>wx.html.HtmlHelpData.GetContents, GetContentsCnt, GetIndex, and
GetIndexCnt methods</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>wx.EventLoop is now implemented for wxMac.</p>
<p>Added wxPython wrappers for the new wx.Treebook and wx.Toolbook
classes.</p>
<p>wx.DC.BeginDrawing and EndDrawing have been deprecated in the C++
code, so since they never really did anything before they are now just
empty stubs in wxPython.</p>
<p>Solved a problem that has been around for a very long time in how C++
methods are virtualized for overriding in derived Python classes.
Previously we couldn't do it for methods that needed to also exist in
the base class wrappers such that they could be called normally.  (The
reasons are long and complex, but suffice it to say that it was due to
mixing C++'s dynamic dispatch, and Python's runtime lookup of the
method attributes resulting in endless recursion of function calls.)
Because of this problem I used a hack that I have always hated, and
that is renaming the base class methods with a &quot;base_*&quot; prefix, for
example wx.Printout.base_OnBeginDocument.  Now that the problem has
finally been solved I have replaced all the base_Whatever() methods
with the real Whatever() method as well as a simple wrapper named
base_Whatever that is marked as deprecated.  So now instead of writing
your overridden methods like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def OnBeginDocument(self, start, end):
    # do something here
    return self.base_OnBeginDocument(start, end)
</pre>
<p>You can now call the base class method the normal way, like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def OnBeginDocument(self, start, end):
    # do something here
    return Printout.OnBeginDocument(self, start, end)
</pre>
<p>Or like this with super():</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def OnBeginDocument(self, start, end):
    # do something here
    return super(MyPrintout, self).OnBeginDocument(start, end)
</pre>
<p>Note that the old way with the &quot;base_*&quot; function still works, but you
will get a DeprecationWarning from calling base_OnBeginDocument.  The
classes affected by this are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>wx.DropSource</li>
<li>wx.DropTarget</li>
<li>wx.TextDropTarget</li>
<li>wx.FileDropTarget</li>
<li>wx.PyLog   (also added the ability to override Flush)</li>
<li>wx.PyApp   (also added the ability to override ExitMainLoop)</li>
<li>wx.Printout</li>
<li>wx.PyPrintPreview</li>
<li>wx.PyPreviewFrame</li>
<li>wx.PreviewControlBar</li>
<li>wx.Process</li>
<li>wx.PyControl</li>
<li>wx.PyPanel</li>
<li>wx.PyScrolledWindow</li>
<li>wx.PyWindow</li>
<li>wx.Timer</li>
<li>wx.grid.PyGridCellRenderer</li>
<li>wx.grid.PyGridCellEditor</li>
<li>wx.grid.PyGridCellAttrProvider</li>
<li>wx.grid.PyGridTableBase</li>
<li>wx.html.HtmlWindow</li>
<li>wx.wizard.PyWizardPage</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Added the wx.DC.GradientFillConcentric and wx.DC.GradientFillLinear
methods.</p>
<p>wxGTK: wx.ListBox and wx.CheckListBox are now using native GTK2
widgets.</p>
<p>Added wx.ListBox.HitTest() from patch 1446207</p>
<p>Bumped up to SWIG 1.3.29.  This provides some more runtime performance
boosts, gets rid of the dreaded Ptr classes, and some other nice new
things.</p>
<p>Added wx.Window.GetScreenPosition and GetScreenRect which returns the
position of the window in screen coordinates, even if the window is
not a top-level window.</p>
<p>Added GetResourcesDir and GetLocalizedResourcesDir to
wx.StandardPaths.</p>
<p>Added a GetReceivedFormat method to wx.DataObjectComposite.  You can
use this to find out what format of data object was recieved from the
source of the clipboard or DnD operation, and then you'll know which
of the component data objects to use to access the data.</p>
<p>Changed how the stock objects (wx.RED, wx.RED_PEN, wx.RED_BRUSH, etc.)
are initialized.  They are now created as uninitialized instances
using __new__.  Then after the wx.App has been created, but before
OnInit is called, the .this attribute of each object is initialized.
This was needed because of some delayed initialization functionality
that was implemented in wxWidgets, but the end result is cleaner for
wxPython as well, and allowed me to remove some ugly code previously
hidden under the covers.</p>
<p>Added wx.StandardPaths.GetDocumentsDir.</p>
<p>Added wx.RendererNative.DrawCheckButton.</p>
<p>wx.ProgressDialog.Update now returns a tuple of two values.  The first
is a continue flag (what was returned before) and the second is a skip
flag.  If the dialog has the wx.PD_CAN_SKIP flag and if the Skip
button is clicked, then the skip flag is set to True the next time
Update is called.</p>
<p>A DeprecationWarning is now issued when the old wxPython package is
imported.  If you are still using the old namespace please convert
your code to use the new wx package instead.</p>
<p>Added wrappers for Julian's new wxRichTextCtrl class, visible in
wxPython as wx.richtext.RichTextCtrl window.  It still needs some more
work, but it is a great start.</p>
<p>wx.lib.mixins.listctrl.TextEditMixin: Fixed the double END_LABEL_EDIT
event problem in TextEditMixin by checking if the editor was already
hidden before continuing with the CloseEditor method.  Also added code
to OpenEditor to send the BEGIN_LABEL_EDIT event and to not allow the
opening of the editor to continue if the event handler doesn't allow
it.</p>
<p>wx.StaticBoxSizer now keeps better track of the wx.StaticBox, and it
will destroy it if the sizer is destroyed before the parent window is.</p>
<p>Added wx.HyperlinkCtrl.</p>
<p>Added battery and power related functions and events (wxMSW only so
far.)  See wx.PowerEvent, wx.GetPowerType and wx.GetBatteryState.</p>
<p>Added wx.ListCtrl.HitTestSubItem which returns the sub-item (i.e. the
column in report mode) that was hit (if any) in addition to the item
and flags.</p>
<p>Added wrappers for wx.ColourPickerCtrl, wx.DirPickerCtrl,
wx.FilePickerCtrl, and wx.FontPickerCtrl.</p>
<p>Patch #1502016 wx.Image.ConvertToGreyscale now retains the alpha
channel.</p>
<p>Added wrappers for the wxAUI classes, in the wx.aui module.</p>
<p>Added the PseudoDC class from Paul Lanier.  It provides a way to
record operations on a DC and then play them back later.</p>
<p>Upgraded to Scintilla 1.70 for wx.stc.StyledTextCtrl.</p>
<p>Added CanSetTransparent and SetTransparent methods to the
wx.TopLevelWindow class, with implementations (so far) for wxMSW and
wxMac.</p>
<p>SetDefaultItem() and GetDefaultItem() are now members of
wx.TopLevelWindow, not wx.Panel.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Stock items (icons) will be used for menu items with stock
IDs.</p>
<p>Added wx.lib.combotreebox from Frank Niessink</p>
<p>Added wx.ImageFromBuffer, wx.BitmapFromBuffer and
wx.BitmapFromBufferRGBA factory functions.  They enable loading of an
image or bitmap directly from a Python object that implements the
buffer interface, such as strings, arrays, etc.</p>
<p>Added wx.App.IsDisplayAvailable() which can be used to determine if a
GUI can be created in the current environment.  (Still need an
implementation for wxMSW...)</p>
<p>The wx.html.HTML_FONT_SIZE_x constants are no longer available as the
default sizes are now calculated at runtime based on the size of the
normal GUI font.</p>
<p>wx.Colour now includes an alpha component, which defaults to
wx.ALPHA_OPAQUE.  This is in preparation for allowing various new
alpha blening functionality using wx.Colour objects, such as drawing
with pens and brushes on a wx.DC.</p>
<p>Added wx.NativePixelBuffer, wx.AlphPixelBuffer and related iterator
and accessor classes.  They allow platform independent direct access
to the platform specific pixel buffer inside of a wx.Bitmap object.</p>
<p>The beginnings of support for RTL languages has been added, thanks to
a Google SoC project.</p>
<p>Added wx.lib.dragscroller from Riaan Booysen.  It provides a helper
class that can used to scroll a wx.ScrolledWindow in response to a
mouse drag.</p>
<p>Applied patch 1551409: Adds support for indeterminate mode gauges.</p>
<p>wxMac: I've turned on the compile option for using the native toolbar
on the Mac now that it supports hosting of controls.  If the toolbar
is managed by the frame via either CreateToolBar() or SetToolBar()
then the native toolbar will be used.  Additional toolbars, or
toolbars that are not children of the frame, are managed by sizers or
what-not will still use the emulated toolbar because of platform
restrictions in how/where the native toolbar can be used.</p>
<p>Added Python properties for many of the getter/setter methods of wx
classes.  In order for the names to be predicatble for somebody
already familiar with wxPython the property names are simply the name
of the getter with the &quot;Get&quot; dropped.  For example, wx.Window has a
property named &quot;Size&quot; that maps to GetSize and SetSize.  So far there
is only one known name conflict using this naming convention, and that
is wx.KeyEvent.KeyCode, however since KeyCode was formerly a
compatibility alias for GetKeyCode (and has been for a long time) it
was decided to just switch it to a property.  If you want to use the
method then change your calls to event.KeyCode() to
event.GetKeyCode(), otherwise you can use it as a property just by
dropping the parentheses.</p>
<p>Updated the C++ code for wx.gizmos.TreeListCtrl from the wxCode
project.  This has resulted in some minor API changes, most of which
were worked around in the wrapper code.</p>
<p>Added wx.lib.delayedresult from Oliver Schoenborn.</p>
<p>Added wx.lib.expando, a multi-line textctrl that expands as more lines
are needed.</p>
<p>wx.Image.Scale and Rescale methods now take an extra parameter
specifying type of method to use for resampling the image.  It
defaults to the current behavior of just replicating pixels, if
wx.IMAGE_QUALITY_HIGH is passed then it uses bicubic and box averaging
resampling methods for upsampling and downsampling respectively.</p>
<p>Added the wx.lib.buttonpanel module, which is a tweaked version of
Andrea Gavana's FancyButtonPanel module.</p>
<p>Added the wx.lib.flatnotebook module, from Andrea Gavana.</p>
<p>Renamed wx.FutureCall to wx.CallLater so it is named more like
wx.CallAfter.  wx.FutureCall is now an empty subclass of wx.CallLater
for compatibility of older code.</p>
<p>Added the wx.lib.customtreectrl module from Andrea Gavana.</p>
<p>Added ChangeSelection to wx.BookCtrl (the base class for wx.Notebook
and other book controls) that is the same as SetSelection but doesn't
send the change events.</p>
<p>Added wx.TextCtrl.ChangeValue() which is the same as SetValue() but
doesn't send the text changed event.</p>
<p>For consistency, all classes having an Ok() method now also have
IsOk(), use of the latter form is preferred although the former hasn't
been deprecated yet</p>
<p>Added the wx.AboutBox() function and wx.AboutDialogInfo class.  They
provide a way to show a standard About box for the application, which
will either be a native dialog or a generic one depending on what info
is provided and if it can all be shown with the native dialog.</p>
<p>The code in the animate contrib has been moved into the core wxWidgets
library, and refactored a bit along the way.  For wxPython it still
exists in the wx.animate module, but has basically been reduced to two
classes, wx.animate.Animation, and wx.animate.AnimationCtrl.  You load
the animated GIF (and hopefully there will be other supported formats
in the near future) in the Animation object, and then give that to the
AnimatedCtrl for display.  See the demo for an example.  There is also
still a GIFAnimationCtrl class that provides some level of backwards
compatibility with the old implementation.</p>
<p>wxMac: The compile option that turns on the use of CoreGraphics (a.k.a
Quartz) for wxDC is now turned on by default.  This means that all
drawing via wxDC is done using the new APIs from apple, instead of the
old Quick Draw API.  There are, however, a few places where Quartz and
wxDC don't fit together very well, mainly the lack of support for
logical drawing operations such as XOR, but there is work in progress
to provide other ways to do the same sort of thing that will work with
Quartz and also on the other platforms.</p>
<p>The first parts of a new 2D drawing API has been added with the
wx.GraphicsPath and wx.GraphicsContext classes.  They wrap GDI+ on
Windows, Cairo on wxGTK and CoreGraphics on OS X.  They allow path-based
drawing with alpha-blending and anti-aliasing, and use a floating
point cooridnate system.  Currently they can only target drawing to
windows, but other wx.DC backends are forthcoming.  The APIs may
evolve a bit more before they are finalaized with the 2.8 release, but
there is enough there now to get a good feel for how things will work.
There is also a transitional wx.GCDC class that provides the wx.DC API
on top of wx.GraphicsContext.  Docs and a demo are still MIA.</p>
<p>Added a wx.AutoBufferedPaintDC that is a subclass of wx.PaintDC on
platforms that do double buffering by default, and a subclass of
wx.BufferedPaintDC on the platforms that don't.  You can use this
class to help avoid the overhead of buffering when it is not
needed. There is also a wx.AutoBufferedPaintDCFactory function that
does a little more and actually tests if the window has
double-buffering enabled and then decides whether to return a
wx.PaintDC or wx.BufferedPaintDC.  This uses the new
wx.Window.IsDoubleBuffered method.</p>

<dt>DocView and ActiveGrid IDE updates from Morgan Hua:</dt>
<dd>New Features: In Tab-View mode, Ctrl-number will take the user to
the numbered tab view.  Modified files now show an '*' astrisk in
the view title.  Debugger framework can now support PHP debugging.
Not important for python development, but at least that means the
debugger framework is more generalized.</dd>

<p>wx.lib.mixins.listctrl.TextEditMixin: Fixed the double END_LABEL_EDIT
event problem in TextEditMixin by checking if the editor was already
hidden before continuing with the CloseEditor method.  Also added code
to OpenEditor to send the BEGIN_LABEL_EDIT event and to not allow the
opening of the editor to continue if the event handler doesn't allow

<p>Undeprecated wx.GetNumberFromUser and added wx.NumberEntryDialog.</p>
<p>Made necessaary changes for building wxPython for Python 2.5.  There
may still be some issues related to the new Py_ssize_t type and 64-bit
machines, but at least all compile errors and warnings related to it
have been resolved.</p>

<p>Fixed reference leak in wx.gizmos.TreeListCtrl.GetSelections.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed sizing issue with wx.Choice and wx.ComboBox.  This change
was implemented by reverting a prior fix for a different problem
(contiuous painting/resizing when a combobox is used as a widget in a
wx.html.HtmlWindow) so a method to fix both problems is still being
investigated.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Fixed potential buffer overrun when pasting from the
clipboard.</p>
<p>Fixed problem in wx.lib.splitter when used on 64-bit platforms.  Used
the current length of the list for specifying an append instead of
sys.maxint.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Support added for XP themed owner drawn buttons and bitmap
buttons.  For example, if you change the foreground color of a button
it will now be drawn with the XP themed style rather than an ugly
generic button style.</p>
<p>XRCed: Fix for Copy/Paste objects with international characters.</p>
<p>Fixed the equality and inequality operators for some of the basic
data types (wx.Point, wx.Size, wx.Colour, etc.) to no longer raise a
TypeError if the compared object is not compatible, but to just return
a boolean as expected.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wx.Colour(64,0,64) == 123      ==&gt; False
</pre>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed (again) sizing/positioning issues of calling Realize on
a wx.ToolBar that is not manaaged directly by a frame and that is
already shown.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed wx.Choice/wx.ComboBox so they send events when a new item
is selected only with the keyboard.</p>

<p>Change the wx.ListCtrl InsertStringItem wrapper to use the form that
takes an imageIndex, and set the default to -1.  This ensures that on
wxMSW that if there is an image list but they don't specify an image,
the native control doesn't use one anyway.</p>
<p>wxMSW: wx.ListCtrl in report mode is now able to support images in
other columns besides the first one.  Simply pass an image index to
SetStringItem.  For virtual list controls you can specify the image to
use on the extra columns by overriding OnGetItemColumnImage in your
derived class.  It is passed the item number and the column number as
parameters, and the default version simply calls OnGetItemImage for
column zero, or returns -1 for other columns.</p>
<p>Switched to using SWIG 1.3.27 for generating the wrapper code.  There
are some small changes needed to SWIG to work around some bugs that
wxPython exposes, and to be able to generate code that matches that
which wxPython is using.  If you are building wxPython yourself and
need to modify any of the *.i files or to add your own, then you will
want to be sure to use a matching SWIG.  See wxPython/SWIG/README.txt
in the source tarball for details.</p>
<p>wx.Image.Copy, Mirror, and GetSubImage now also do the right thing
with  the alpha channel.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed problem in wx.TextCtrl where using SetValue and
wx.TE_RICH2 would cause the control to be shown if it was hidden.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Numpad special keys are now distinguished from normal keys in
key events.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Multiline notebook tab label change now resizes the control
correctly if an extra row is removed or added.</p>
<p>wxMSW: On XP fall back to unthemed wxNotebook if specified orientation
not available in the themed version.</p>
<p>Added wx.Toolbar.GetToolsCount.</p>
<p>Added wx.GridSizer.CalcRowsCols.</p>
<p>Added wx.OutputStream.LastWrite.</p>
<p>wxGTK: EVT_SET_CURSOR is now sent.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Fix RequestMore for idle events.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Implement user dashes for PS and GNOME printing.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Correct update region code. Don't always invalidate the whole
window upon resize. Reenable support for thewx.NO_FULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE
flag.  Also disable refreshing custom controls when focusing in and out.</p>
<p>wx.lib.pubsub: Publisher is now able to parse a dotted notation string
into a topic tuple.  For example: subscribing to &quot;timer.clock.seconds&quot;
is the same as subscribing to (&quot;timer&quot;, &quot;clock&quot;, &quot;seconds&quot;).</p>
<p>Applied patch #1441370: lib.plot - allow passing in wx.Colour()</p>
<p>Added wx.CommandEvent.GetClientData.</p>
<p>Updated wxStyledTextCtrl to use version 1.67 of Scintilla.
NOTE: The STC_LEX_ASP and STC_LEX_PHP lexers have been deprecated,
you should use STC_LEX_HTML instead.</p>
<p>wxSTC: Implemented Fix for SF Bug #1436503.  Delay the start of the
DnD operation in case the user just intended to click, not drag.</p>
<p>Updated the analogclock.py module to the new analogclock package from
E. A. Tacao.</p>
<p>Added the wx.lib.mixins.listctrl.CheckListCtrlMixin class from Bruce
Who, which makes it easy to put checkboxes on list control items.</p>
<p>Applied a patch from Christian Kristukat to wx.lib.plot that adds
scrollbars when the plot is zoomed in, and also the ability to grab a
zoomed plot and move it around with a mouse drag.</p>
<p>XRCed updated to allow wxMenuBar to be created inside a wxFrame.</p>
<p>Added wx.StandardPaths.GetDocumentsDir() (patch 1214360)</p>

<p>wxMSW: Fix for bug #1211907, popup menu indenting inconsistent with
bitmaps.</p>
<p>wxMac: Don't send an event for wx.RadioButton deselections, just the
selections.  This was done to make it consistent with the other
platforms.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Always set flat toolbar style, even under XP with themes: this

<p>Fixes for bug #1217872, pydocview.DocService not correctly initialized.</p>
<p>Fix for bug #1217874, Error in parameter name in DocManager.CreateView.</p>
<p>Added wrappers for the wx.RendererNative class.</p>
<p>Added the wx.lib.splitter module, which contains the
MultiSplitterWindow class.  This class is much like the standard
wx.SplitterWindow class, except it allows more than one split, so it
can manage more than two child windows.</p>
<p>Docview and IDE patch from Morgan Hua with fix for bug #1217890
&quot;Closing view crashes Python&quot; plus some new features:</p>
<blockquote>
New feature added to the IDE is 'Extensions'.  Under
Tools|Options|Extensions, you can add calls to external programs.
For example you can add a &quot;Notepad&quot; extension (under windows) that
will exec Notepad on the currently open file.  A new &quot;Notepad&quot;
menu item will appear under the Tools menu.</blockquote>
<p>Some fixes to XRCed to make encoding errors a bit more user friendly.</p>
<p>XRCed changes from Roman Rolinsky:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added new controls (Choicebook, Listbook, StatusBar,
DatePicker), and completed style flags. Test window is opened
for an available parent control if no specific view
defined. Better handling of exceptions (highlighting does not
'stick' anymore).</li>
<li>Use system clipboard for Copy/Paste.</li>
<li>Improved some dialogs (window styles, growable cols). Changed
the range for wxSpinCtrl min/max to all integers (default 0/100
is not always good).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Updates for wx.lib.foldpanelbar and wx.lib.hyperlink from Andrea
Gavana.</p>
<p>Fix for Bug #1283496: wxPython TheClipboard class causes problems for
pychecker.  Ensure the app has been created before initializing
wx.TheClipboard.</p>
<p>Fix for Bug #1352602: FileBrowseButtonWithHistory can't type in Value.</p>
<p>wxHTML: Added space after list item number.</p>
<p>wx.lib.printout:  Applied patch #1384440.</p>
<p>wxMSW:  Fix for Bug #1293225 Window_FromHWND crashes if parent is
None.</p>
<p>Fix for Bug #1261669, use a wx.TE_RICH2 style for the Process demo so
it doesn't fill up too soon.</p>
<p>Applied Patch #1354389: wxPython MenuItem SetBitmaps fix.</p>
<p>Applied Patch #1239456: wxPython wx.DataObject.GetAllFormats fix.</p>
<p>Applied Patch # #1230107 which allows image handlers to be written in
Python by deriving from wx.PyImageHandler.</p>
<p>Applied patch #1072210: generalize printout.py to allow text printing.</p>
<p>Applied patch #1243907: Give Throbber much more flexibility by
allowing the user to set the rest image, the direction, the current
index, custom sequence.  Allows user to manually step through the
sequence with Next(), Previous(), Increment(), Decrement() &amp;
SetCurrent(). Very handy if you have multiple throbbers that you want
to synchronize with a single timer.</p>
<p>Fix for bug #1336711: wx.lib.calendar.CalenDlg can yield incorrect

<p>Applied patch #1326241: Supporting &quot;setup.py install --install-headers=path&quot;</p>
<p>Applied patch from Morgan Hua to fix bug #1219423: CommandManager

instead of a separate menu item.</p>
<p>Fix for bug #1266745 and #1387725 in the wx.FindReplaceDialog on MSW.
Actually check we are using MSLU before doing the hack designed to
workaround a bug in MSLU!</p>
<p>wxMSW: wx.lib.iewin.IEHtmlWindow now properly handles tabbing, return
and other special keys properly.</p>
<p>Lots of PyCrust enhancments started by Franz Steinaeusler, Adi Sieker,
and Sebastian Haase, and which in turn were further enhanced, fixed
tweaked and finished up by me.  The changes include the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Autocomplete and Calltip windows can now be opened manually
with Ctrl-Space and Ctrl-Shift-Space.</li>
<li>In the stand alone PyCrust app the various option settings,
window size and position, and etc. are saved and restored at the
next run.</li>
<li>Added a help dialog bound to the F1 key that shows the key
bindings.</li>
<li>Added a new text completion function that suggests words from
the history.  Bound to Shift-Return.</li>
<li>F11 will toggle the maximized state of the frame.</li>
<li>switched to Bind() from wx.EVT_*().</li>
<li>Display of line numbers can be toggled.</li>
<li>F12 toggles a &quot;free edit&quot; mode of the shell buffer.  This mode
is useful, for example, if you would like to remove some output
or errors or etc. from the buffer before doing a copy/paste.
The free edit mode is designated by the use of a red,
non-flashing caret.</li>
<li>Ctrl-Shift-F will fold/unfold (hide/show) the selected lines.</li>
<li>General code cleanup and fixes.</li>
<li>Use wx.StandardPaths to determine the location of the config
files.</li>
<li>Use wx.SP_LIVE_UPDATE on crust and filling windows.</li>
<li>Extended the saving of the config info and other new features to
the PyShell app too.  Additionally, other apps that embed a
PyCrust or a PyShell can pass their own wx.Config object and
have the Py code save/restore its settings to/from there.</li>
<li>All of the classes with config info get an opportunity to
save/load their own settings instead of putting all the
save/load code in one place that then has to reach all over the
place to do anything.</li>
<li>Enable editing of the startup python code, which will either be
the file pointed to by PYTHONSTARTUP or a file in the config dir
if PYTHONSTARTUP is not set in the environment.</li>
<li>Added an option to skip the running of the startup code when
PyShell or PyCrust starts.</li>
<li>PyCrust adds a pp(item) function to the shell's namespace that
pretty prints the item in the Display tab of the notebook.
Added code to raise that tab when pp() is called.</li>
<li>Added an option for whether to insert text for function
parameters when popping up the call tip.</li>
<li>Added Find and Find-Next functions that use the
wx.FindReplaceDialog.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Applied patches from Will Sadkin for wx.lib.masked modules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Now ignores kill focus events when being destroyed.</li>
<li>Added missing call to set insertion point on changing fields.</li>
<li>Modified SetKeyHandler() to accept None as means of removing
one.</li>
<li>Fixed keyhandler processing for group and decimal character
changes.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem that prevented input into the integer digit of a
integerwidth=1 numctrl, if the current value was 0.</li>
<li>Fixed logic involving processing of &quot;_signOk&quot; flag, to remove
default sign key handlers if false, so that
SetAllowNegative(False) in the NumCtrl works properly.</li>
<li>Fixed selection logic for numeric controls so that if
selectOnFieldEntry is true, and the integer portion of an
integer format control is selected and the sign position is
selected, the sign keys will always result in a negative value,
rather than toggling the previous sign.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>wx.FontMapper.SetConfig is deprecated.  You should instead just set an
application-wide config object with wx.Config.Set, which wx.FontMapper
will use by default.</p>
<p>Added wx.GetMouseState which returns the current state of the mouse.
It returns an instance of a wx.MouseState object that contains the
current position of the mouse pointer in screen coordinants, as well
as boolean values indicating the up/down status of the mouse buttons
and the modifier keys.</p>
<p>Added wx.SizerItem.SetUserData</p>
<p>A variety of updates to wx.lib.floatcanvas, including Added
DrawObjects, including a ScaledTextBox, with auto-wrapping, etc, and
Scaled and Unscaled Bitmap Objects.</p>
<blockquote>
WARNING: Changed all DrawObjects to take an (x,y) pair rather
than individual x,y parameters. Also changed rectangles and
ellipses to take (w,h) pair. This is an API change, but should
be easy to accommodate, all you need to do is add a parenthesis
pair:  (...x, y, ...) ---&gt;  (...(x,y), ...)</blockquote>

<p>Added wx.BrushFromBitmap to create a stippled brush in a single step.

wx.STIPPLE_MASK_OPAQUE.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fix for default control colours when the system text fg colour
is not black.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Patch #1171754, It is now possible to have a menu item that
both has an icon and is a submenu.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Patch #1197009, better refreshes when windows are moved and
resized.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Patch #1197468.  Keeps track of pending size/position changes
in case there is more than one adjustment for a window in a single
DeferWindowPos set, then the pending values can be used for defaults
instead of current values.</p>
<p>Fixed the typemap that converts a Python list of strings to a
wxArrayString so it uses the wxPython default encoding.</p>
<p>Several docstrings added and updated.  Lots more to go.</p>
<p>wxMac: Strings added to the clipboard or used in DnD no longer have an
extra null character at the end.</p>
<p>Added wx.GetXDisplay that returns a raw swigified pointer for the X11
Display, or None for the non-X11 platforms.</p>
<p>wxMenu: Don't send an event when selecting an already selected radio
item.</p>
<p>Added wx.LaunchDefaultBrowser.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed erroneous selection of content in wx.ComboBox when within
a wx.StaticBox.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed alpha blitting to take into account source position.</p>
<p>Ensure that Python is still in an initialized state before doing any
locking or unlocking in wxPyBeginBlockThreads and wxPyEndBlockThreads
as these can be triggered after Python has been finalized in embedding
situations.</p>
<p>Added alternate constructors for wx.Font: wx.FontFromPixelSize,
wx.FFont, wx.FFontFromPixelSize.  See the docstrings or new api docs
for details.</p>
<p>Added wx.lib.hyperlink from Andrea Gavana.  It is a control like
static text that acts like a hyper-link, launching the system's
default browser in response to the clicks.</p>
<p>Added an optional parameter to wxversion.select that allows you to
specify that the extra components specified in the version string are
required.  For example, if you ask for &quot;2.6-unicode&quot; but only the ansi
version is installed then by default the ansi version will be selected
as it considered close enough since the version numbers match.  If you
want to force the options to be required then you can just add a True
parameter, like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import wxversion
wxversion.select(&quot;2.6-unicode&quot;, True)
import wx
</pre>
<p>Tweaked wx.lib.buttons such that flat buttons (e.g. have no bevel and
a wx.BORDER_NONE style flag) paint themed backgrounds if there are
transparent areas and the parent is displaying a theme.</p>
<p>wxMSW:  Fix for wrong sash colour of wx.SplitterWindow in the silver
theme on XP.</p>
<p>Added a wx.xrc.XmlResourceHandler for the Ticker class.  See
wx/lib/ticker_xrc.py</p>
<p>wxSTC: Fixed CmdKeyAssign key bindings for Ctrl-Backspace.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed a bug in wx.TextCtrl where all the lines were being used
to calculate the best size, instead of using a reasonable limit.</p>
<p>XRCed: Use wx.GetDefaultPyEncoding/wx.SetDefaultPyEncoding for
changing active encoding.  Fixed pasting siblings (Ctrl key pressed
while pasting).</p>
<p>wx.lib.filebrowsebutton: Bug fix from Chad Netzer for when
self.history is None.</p>
<p>wx.ogl: Patch from Davide Salomoni that adds an optional point
parameter to LineShape.InsertLineControlPoint allowing one to
optionally specify where the new control point has to be drawn.</p>
<p>wxMSW: setting foreground colour for wx.CheckBox now works when using
XP themes.</p>
<p>More updates to the docview library modules and sample apps from the
ActiveGrid folks.  Their sample IDE is now able to integrate with
Subversion.</p>
<p>wx.grid.Grid:  Ensure that the grid gets the focus when it is
left-clicked.  Note that if you have custom widgets that handle the
EVT_LEFT_DOWN event but do not call event.Skip() then you will
probably want to add a call to self.SetFocus in the event handler.</p>
<p>wxGTK:  Add wxSTAY_ON_TOP support [Patch 1206023]</p>
<p>wx.TreeCtrl:  wx.EVT_TREE_ITEM_MENU event made consistent on all
platforms.  The location of the click or the item is included in the
event as well.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Setting background colour of a window now only affects the
window itself, not the borders, scrollbars, etc.  (Bug #1204069)</p>
<p>Print framework:  Add more paper sizes and code to fallback to an
explicit paper size if a known paper size is not found for the
printer.</p>
<p>wxMac: Applied patch for bug #1206181 Option-key decodes are wrong,
also applied patch for bug #1205691 Modified Fn keys don't work.</p>
<p>wx.Image: Fixed to preserve alpha channel in Rotate90 method.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed incorrect background colour on wx.CheckListBox.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Fixed drawing of owner drawn buttons with multiline labels</p>
<p>Removed a bunch of unnecessary files, and removed or replaced images
that we're not sure of their origin or license.</p>
<p>The default DoGetBestSize is updated to not always return the current
size if the window has no sizer, children, or minsize set.  Instead
the current size is set as the minsize.  This solves the occasional
problem where a sizer may cause a childless panel to grow but never
shrink.</p>
<p>wxMSW: When converting a wx.Icon to a bitmap check if the icon has an
alpha channel and set the bitmap to use it.</p>
<p>Fixed the wrong class name used in wx.PyScrolledWindow's call to
_setCallbackInfo.</p>
<p>wxMSW: patch #1207202, Fixes GDI leak when using stock cursors.</p>
<p>wx.calendar.CalendarCtrl: Patch #1207531, Keeps the CalendarCtrl wide
enough even when the weekday names for the locale are shorter than
usual.</p>
<p>Made GridCellNumberEditor.StartingKey also insert the typed char when
there is a range of allowed values (so a wx.SpinCtrl is used instead
of a wx.TextCtrl.)</p>

<p>wxGTK:  The configure flags for selecting GTK+ 1.2.x or 2.x has
changed slightly.  It is now --with-gtk[=VERSION] where VERSION is
either '1', '2' or 'any'.  The default is '2'.</p>
<p>wx.stc.StyledTextCtrl: Added the following methods for alternate ways
to set and fetch text from the document buffer.  They work similarly
to the existing methods of the same name, except that they don't go
through the same string/unicode &lt;--&gt; wxString conversions.  The &quot;Raw&quot;
methods will do no conversions at all and in a unicode build of
wxPython the strings will be in the utf-8 encoding and in an ansi
build no assumption is made about the encoding.  The &quot;UTF8&quot; functions
will attempt to always get/set utf-8 text, which it will always be
able to do in a unicode build, and in an ansi build it will depend on
the content of the utf-8 used being compatible with the current
encoding, (you'll get an exception otherwise.)</p>

<p>wx.grid.Grid: Fixed bug #1163384.  Moved the code that handles
activating the cell editors to a EVT_CHAR event handler.  This is done
so the character inserted into the editor will be the &quot;cooked&quot; char
value (including accented or composed keys) rather than the raw code

<p>Added GetCount, GetCountRGB, and GetCountColour methods to
wx.ImageHistogram.</p>
<p>wxMSW: wx.Window.Refresh changed to explicitly refresh all children as
well as the parent.  Previously it was implicitly done because parents
did not clip their children by default.  Now that they always clip
children then Refresh needed to be fixed to do a recursive refresh.

wxFoldPanelBar classes to Python.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Applied patch #1173802, reimplementation of GtkFileChooser
wxFileDialog by Mart Raudsepp.  Note that this new file dialog is only
used on GTK2 &gt;= 2.4.  For earlier GTK2 versions and GTK1 then the
older generic file dialog is used.</p>
<p>wxMSW: fixes to static box borders calculations (finalizes patch

<p>wx.Image: Use Python's buffer interface API for all image data and
alpha Set/Get methods and the ImageFromData* constructors.  They all
still copy the buffer except for SetDataBuffer and SetAlphaBuffer, but
this gives more flexibility on where the data can come from.</p>

<p>wx.Sizer Add, Insert, and Prepend functions now return a reference to the
wx.SizerItem that was added to the sizer, and the wx.SizerItem has a
GetRect accessor to give the position of the item on the parent window.</p>
<p>Added wx.Sizer.GetItem method which returns the wx.SizerItem for the given
wx.Window, wx.Sizer or position index.</p>
<p>wxMSW: wx.RadioButtons in the same group no longer have to be
consecutive (there may be intervening controls). Without this fix, an
out-of-sync assert is generated when clicking on a radio button and
then calling GetValue().</p>

<li>Added 'icon' property to wxFrame and wxDialog</li>
<li>No longer ignores menu bitmaps on non-MSW platforms</li>

<p>wxMSW: fix for [ 1052989 ] TextCtrl.SetBackgroundColour(wx.NullColour)
bug.</p>
<p>Added wx.PasswordEntryDialog analagous to wx.TextEntryDialog, allows
detecting entering an empty string vs. cancel unlike the
wx.GetPasswordFromUser dialog function.</p>
<p>OGL patch from Shane Holloway:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two simple problems found in the new python ogl code.  First is
the patch for _canvas.py.  Essentially:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
dx = abs(dc.LogicalToDeviceX(x - self._firstDragX))
dy = abs(dc.LogicalToDeviceY(y - self._firstDragY))
</pre>
<p>was incorrect because (x,y) and (self._firstDragX,
self._firstDragY) are both already in Logical coordinates.
Therefore the difference between the two is also in logical
coordinates, and the conversion call is an error.  This bug
surfaces when you have OGL on a scrollwin, and you are far from
the origin of the canvas.</p>
<p>The second change in _composit.py basically removes the assumption
that the child is in both self._children and self._divisions.
Causes many problems when it's not.  ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fixed GetSaveData and SetSaveData in wx.lib.multisash to not depend on
the default way that class objectss are converted to strings.</p>
<p>Fixed problem in StyledTextCtrl.Set[HV]ScrollBar that could leave the
internal scrollbar visible.</p>
<p>Added wx.StandardPaths which provides methods for determining standard
system paths for each platform.</p>
<p>wxMSW: The window background is now only erased by default if the
background colour or background mode has been changed.  This better
allows the default system themed behaviour to show through for
uncustomized windows.  Explicit support added for using the correct
theme texture for wx.Notebook pages and their children.</p>
<p>wx.Image: Added support for alpha channels in interpolated and
non-interpolated image rotation.  Added ConvertAlphaToMask helper
method for turning shades of grey into shades of alpha and a colour.</p>
<p>wxGTK2: Reimplemented DoDrawRotatedText() by way of a rotation of an
alpha blended text bitmap.  It would be better if Pango could draw
directly into an wxImage (as FreeType can,) but that is for later...</p>
<p>Added wrappers and a demo for the wx.MediaCtrl class, which can play
various forms of audio/video media using native codecs install on the
system.  So far it is only implemented for Windows and OSX.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Patch applied for Freeze()/Thaw() for wxTextCtrtl.</p>
<p>Added &quot;gravity&quot; for splitter window (patch 1046105). Gravity is a
floating-point factor between 0.0 and 1.0 which controls position of
sash while resizing the wx.SplitterWindow.  The gravity specifies
how much the left/top window will grow while resizing.</p>
<p>wxMSW: wx.Slider's C++ implementation rewritten to be more
maintainable and hopefully less buggy.  The position of the labels has
also been changed in order to better comply with Microsoft's examples
of how to use the control.</p>
<p>wxMSW:  Fix wx.TreeCtrl to end label editing if the control loses
focus (a slightly modified patch 1084592.)</p>
<p>Added wx.EXEC_NODISABLE flag for wx.Execute, which will prevent all
the app's windows being disabled while a synchronous child process is
running.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Much work to correct painting (or leaving transparent) of
control backgrounds, properly using background themes on XP, etc.</p>
<p>Fixed a circular reference problem with wx.Timer.  It will now
completely cleanup after itself when the last reference to the timer
is removed.  If you were previously using timer.Destroy() to cleanup
your timers it will no longer work.  Instead you should hold a
reference to the timer and then del the reference when you are
finished with the timer.</p>
<p>Updated to 1.3.24 of SWIG.  All of my big patches have been applied to
the main SWIG source tree, but unfortunatly there were also some bugs
added that affected the wxPython build and a few details in my
original patch were changed/removed, so we are still not free of
patches.  A new patch for SWIG is located in the wxPython/SWIG
directory of the wxPython source tree.  SWIG 1.3.24 plus this patch
should be used by anyone who is making custom modifications to
wxPython's .i files, or building their own extension modules or
etc. that need to interact with the wxPython swigged types.  For the
morbidly curious, here are a few more details:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Since it is now possible easily and simply share the SWIG type
tables across modules I reverted to always using the stock SWIG
runtime instead of my slightly hacked up version of it exported
via the wxPython C API.</li>
<li>The %name directive is now deprecated so I replaced most uses of
it with a custom %Rename macro that uses %rename internally.
These will evetually need to be replaced with a DocDecl macro
when docstrings are added for those items.</li>
<li>The &quot;this&quot; attribute of all SWIGged classes is no longer a
string containing a &quot;swigified pointer&quot;, but rather a custom
built-in type that holds the real C pointer to the object and
the type info.  It can be converted to a string like the old
value using str() or to the long integer value of the pointer
using long().</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Added SetDefaultPyEncoding and GetDefaultPyEncoding functions which
will set/get the encoding used by wxPython to convert string or
unicode objects to/from wxString objects.  Previously the default
Python encoding was always used, but unless the user had tweaked their
sitecustomize.py file it is always &quot;ascii&quot;, which would result in
errors if the strings contained character codes &gt;= 128.
SetDefaultPyEncoding will now allow you to control which encoding will
be used to do those conversions.  The default encoding is set to the
value of <cite>locale.getdefaultlocale()[1]</cite> when wxPython is first
imported.  Please see <a class="reference" href="http://www.alanwood.net/demos/charsetdiffs.html">http://www.alanwood.net/demos/charsetdiffs.html</a>
for information on the differences between the common latin/roman
encodings.</p>
<p>Added wxStdDialogButtonSizer, which is a a special sizer that knows
how to order and position standard buttons in order to conform to the
current platform's standards.  You simply need to add each <cite>wx.Button</cite>
to the sizer, and be sure to create the buttons using the standard
ID's.  Then call <cite>Realize</cite> and the sizer will take care of the rest.</p>
<p>wxMSW Toolbar: pass correct tool id (and not always -1) to the
EVT_TOOL_RCLICKED handler</p>
<p>wxGTK: Applied patch for combo box SELECTED events (no longer get
lots of surplus events)</p>
<p>wxGTK: Applied patch for proper menu highlight colour detection in
wx.SystemSettings.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Commited scrollbar patch #1093339 which sends lineup, linedown
events based on intercepting the mouse down events.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Applied patch #1102789 which solved conflicts between wxWidgets
and GTK+'s context menu code.</p>
<p>wxGTK: Applied patch #1100327 for correct feedback from DND actions
(not all actions are allowed).</p>
<p>Fixed memory leak in wxGrid::UpdateAttr[Rows][Or][Cols] (patch 1104355)</p>
<p>For efficiency reasons, text controls no longer set the string for
each text updated event, but rather query for the string value only
when GetString is called from an event handler.</p>
<p>Added wx.SL_INVERSE style which will cause wx.Slider to invert the min
and max ends of the slider.</p>
<p>Several patches applied, such as #1111174, #1110252 and others, that
make the generic wx.TreeCtrl (used on wxGTK and wxMac) be more
conistent with the wxMSW native wx.TreeCtrl.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>XRCed:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Edit-&gt;Locate command (Ctrl-L) for quick selection of items.
Works with event-handling controls (buttons, text fields) but
not with labels/sizers.</li>
<li>Some improvements: relative paths for files supplied as command-
line argument work correctly, notebook panels are highlighted
better.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>wxMac: Fixed a long-standing issue where wxSlider controls with a
hardcoded size would misplace their labels behind the slider control.</p>
<p>wx.HtmlListBox fixed so calling RefreshLine(s) will cause the data for
that line to be refetched from the overridden methods in the derived
class.</p>
<p>The default DoGetBestSize now includes the difference (if any) between
the client size and total size of the window, (such as the size of
borders.)  Code that sets the client size using the best size, or that
added extra space to sizers to compensate for this bug may need to be
changed.</p>
<p>Can suppress themed notebook pages with the wxNB_NOPAGETHEME style or
setting system option msw.notebook.themed-background to 0.</p>
<p>wxSyledTextCtrl updated to use Scintilla 1.62.</p>
<p>Can now set the msw.window.no-clip-children system option to 1 to
eliminate weird refresh behaviour (delays between a window being
erased and repainted, giving a ghostly gradual-redraw effect). May be
a temporary 'fix' until properly fixed before 2.6.</p>
<p>wxMac:  Toolbar is now more native looking with borderless toolbar
buttons.</p>
<p>wxMac: Switched wx.Bitmap to use newer Quartz object types and APIs
internally.  This results in faster display and better alpha support.</p>
<p>Added wx.DatePickerCtrl.</p>
<p>wx.html.HtmlWindow now supports background images.</p>
<p>Added wx.lib.gestures module from Daniel Pozmanter which supports
using Mouse Gestures in an application.</p>
<p>wxGTK2: ENTER and LEAVE mouse events are now sent for multi-line text
controls.</p>
<p>wxMSW:  &quot;Alt&quot; key (VK_MENU) now results in WXK_ALT keyboard event, not
WXK_MENU</p>
<p>Added modules from Peter Yared and Morgan Hua that implement the wx
Doc/View framework in pure Python code.  See wx.lib.docview for the
base implementation and wx.lib.pydocview for Python-specific
extensions.  There are also a couple sample applications located in
samples/docview.</p>
<p>Added GetBitmap, GetIcon to wx.ImageList.</p>
<p>wxGTK wx.Button.SetLabel no longer invalidates/resets the font.</p>
<p>wx.Sizer.AddWindow, AddSizer, AddSpacer and etc. have now been
undeprecated at the request of Riaan Booysen, the Boa Constructor team
lead.  Boa needs them to help keep track of what kind of item is being
managed by the sizer.  They are now just simple compatibility aliases
for Add, and etc.</p>
<p>The old C++ version of the OGL lib is no longer built by default.  Use
the Python version in the wx.lib.ogl package instead.</p>
<p>The wx.iewin module is no longer built by default.  You can use the
wx.lib.iewin version instead.</p>
<p>Fixed wx.BufferedPaintDC for scrolled windows to work whether the
buffer is covering only the client area or the full virtual area of
the scrolled window.  By default it will assume that only the client
area is covered.  This is different than the old behavior so to
indicate that the entire virtual area is covered simply add a
style=wx.BUFFER_VIRTUAL_AREA parameter.</p>
<p>wx.gizmos.TreeListCtrl:  Add support for the EVT_TREE_ITEM_GETTOOLTIP
event.</p>
<p>Added Resize, SetRGBRect, Size, and GetOrFindMaskColour methods to
wx.Image.</p>

<p>wxMac fix for metal appearance on wx.ToolBar.</p>
<p>wx.grid.Grid fix allowing DoGetBestSize to be called before CreateGrid

<p>wxMac fix for not sending a native click to a control if it is not

<p>Added wx.lib.ogl.DrawnShape, and fixed various little bugs in the new
OGL.</p>
<p>Added support to XRC and XRCed for the 3-state checkbox flags and also
for wx.ToggleButton.  Updated the generic window styles supported by
XRCed.</p>
<p>It is now possible to create &quot;stock&quot; buttons.  Basically this means
that you only have to provide one of the stock IDs (and either an
empty label or a label that matches the stock label) when creating the
button and wxWidgets will choose the stock label to go with it
automatically.  Additionally on the platforms that have a native
concept of a stock button (currently only GTK2) then the native stock
button will be used.  For example, the following will result in a
button with &quot;Cancel&quot; as the label and if run on wxGTK2 then there will
also be an image of a red X:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
b = wx.Button(parent, wx.ID_CANCEL)
</pre>
<p>Added wx.lib.ticker.Ticker class from Chris Mellon.</p>
<p>Fix some incorrect clipping regions in wxSTC on wxGTK.</p>
<p>Added wrapper for wx.grid.Grid.GetOrCreateCellAttr.</p>
<p>Removed my copy of distutils from the wxPython source tree.  Now that
I am no longer doing builds on Python 2.1 the newest distutils is no
longer needed.  (There is still one small bug in Python 2.2 distutils
on win32, but it is easily worked around.) This sovles the problem of
incorrect builds on some systems where the system installed distutils
has been patched to behave slightly differently, for example SuSE on
x86_64 or Chandler's build.</p>
<p>Updated to SWIG 1.3.22 (plus my patch.)  See wxPython/SWIG/README.txt
in the source tree if you need to use SWIG when building your own copy
of wxPython, or other extension modules that need to integrate with
the wxPython modules.</p>
<p>Added wx.Frame.RequestUserAttention which, if the platform suports it,
will do something (such as flash the task bar item) to suggest to the
user that they should look at that window.</p>
<p>&quot;Fixed&quot; wx.grid.Grid.SetDefaultEditor and SetDefaultRenderer by making
them register the editor or renderer for the &quot;string&quot; data type.</p>
<p>Added depth param to wx.Image.ConvertToBitmap.</p>
<p>Extended the wx.calendar.CalendarCtrl class with methods that get/set
a Python datetime or date object.  (These will only work with Python
2.3+) The methods are PySetDate, PyGetDate, PySetLowerDateLimit,
PySetUpperDateLimit, PySetDateRange, PyGetLowerDateLimit, and
PyGetUpperDateLimit.  Also, CalendarEvent was extended with PySetDate
and PyGetDate methods.</p>
<p>wxMSW: SetBackgroundColour on a wx.Choice or a wx.ComboBox will now
also set the colour of the dropdown.</p>
<p>wxMac: MessageDialog now supports wx.NO_DEFAULT style</p>
<p>wxMSW: added AssociateHandle and DissociateHandle to wx.Window</p>
<p>wxMac: fix for toolbar tooltips</p>
<p>wx.Sizer.Show (and Hide) now take an optional parameter specifying if
the item to be shown should be searched for recursivly in subsizers,
and return a boolean value indicating if the item was found.</p>
<p>wxMSW: fixed MaximizeEvent generation in wx.Frame</p>
<p>wxMSW: fixed sending duplicate EVT_COMBOBOX events</p>
<p>Smoother time estimation updates in wx.ProgressDialog (patch 992813)</p>
<p>Made wx.Listbook events more consistent with wx.Notebook ones (patch
1001271)</p>
<p>Fixed rounding errors in variable status bar panes widths computation
(patch 1030021)</p>
<p>Added possibility to specify printer bin (patch 910272)</p>
<p>wxMSW: fixed wx.ListCtrl's SetWindowStyleFlag() to not remove
WS_VISIBLE; also refresh the control automatically (closes bug
1019440)</p>
<p>Added wx.Choicebook, yet another notebook-like control.</p>
<p>wxMSW: Make radiobutton tab behaviour the same on MSW as in standard
MSW app, i.e. tab into the activated, not necessarily the first radio
button.</p>
<p>Added limited support for wxEventLoop (you can't derive from a
wx.PyEventLoop version yet...)  Updated and moved the sample showing
how to replace the MainLoop to samples/mainloop/mainloop.py.</p>
<p>The C++ xrc lib has been moved out of contrib and into the core, so it
is always built by default.  wxPython's build has also changed
accordingly and will build the xrc module as part of the core set of
modules built by default.  If you were axplicitly using BUILD_XRC then
it will no longer be recognized as a build option, otherwise you
should notice no difference.</p>
<p>wxMac: Fixed radio toolbar buttons to correctly untoggle the others
when a new one is selected.</p>
<p>wxMac: Fixed GetLineLength and GetLineText for MLTE text controls</p>
<p>wxMac: wx.TaskBarIcon is implemented by allowing you to change the
app's icon on the Dock and also specifying a menu that should be
merged with the normal dock popup menu.  See the MigrationGuide for
more details and a warning.</p>
<p>Added wx.TopLevelWindow.IsActive() which tells you if the frame or
dialog is or containts the active window with the keyboard focus.</p>
<p>Added ability to create a font based on pixel size rather than point
size via the FontFromPixelSize constructor.</p>
<p>Updated the Scintilla used by StyledTextCtrl to version 1.61</p>
<p>Improved image HitTest for TreeListCtrl.</p>

<p>wx.ADJUST_MINSIZE is now the default behaviour for window items in
sizers.  This means that the item's GetMinSize and/or GetBestSize will
be called when calculating layout and the return value from that will
be used for the minimum size used by the sizer.  The wx.FIXED_MINSIZE
flag was added that will cause the sizer to use the old behaviour in
that it will <em>not</em> call the window's methods to determine the new best
size, instead the minsize that the window had when added to the sizer
(or the size the window was created with) will always be used.  Please
see the Sizers section in the Migration Guide for more details.</p>
<p>Added new MaskedEditControl code from Will Sadkin.  The modules are
now locaed in their own sub-package, wx.lib.masked.  Demos updated.</p>
<p>The changes that implemented the incompatible wx.DC methods in 2.5.1.5
have been reverted.  The wx.DC methods are now compatible with the 2.4
implemetation.  In addition a set of renamed methods have been added
that take wx.Point and/or wx.Size objects instead of individual
parameters.</p>
<p>Added wx.lib.mixins.listctrl.TextEditMixin, a mixin class that allows
all columns of a wx.ListCtrl in report mode to be edited.</p>
<p>Deprecated the wx.iewin module.</p>
<p>Deprecated the wx.Sizer.AddWindow, AddSizer, AddSpacer methods as well
as their Insert* and Prepend* counterparts.</p>
<p>Added a generic StaticBitmap class in wx.lib.statbmp for the same
reasons that stattext was created, so it could be mouse sensitive on
all platforms like normal windows.  Also updated stattext.py and
buttons.py to handle attribute (font &amp; colour) defaults and
inheritance the new way.  If you have custom controls of your own you
should review stattxt.py or one of the others to see how it is to be
done.</p>
<p>wx.InitAllImageHandlers is now an empty function that does nothing but
exist for backwards compatibility.  The C++ version is now called
automatically when wxPython is initialized.  Since all the handlers
are included in the wxWidgets shared library anyway, this imposes only
a very small amount of overhead and removes several unneccessary
problems.</p>
<p>Replaced wx/lib/pubsub.py with a version that uses weak references to
track the subscribers, plus other fixes/additions.  Thanks go to
Oliver Schoenborn and Robb Shecter.</p>
<p>wxGTK now uses gtk_init_check so wxPython can raise an exception if
there is no DISPLAY available or other initializaion problem.</p>
<p>wx.GetKeyState now has an implementation for wxGTK and is able to
detect the up/down or toggle state of modifier and toggle keys.</p>
<p>The LC_NUMERIC locale is now reset back to &quot;C&quot; (compatibility) when
running on wxGTK to work around the fact that GTK requires the locale
to be set to the system settings but Python depends on LC_NUMERIC
remaining compatible with &quot;C&quot;.</p>
<p>Switched gizmos.TreeListCtrl to the newer version of the code from the
wxCode project.</p>
<p>OGL is dead! LONG LIVE OGL!  (Oops, sorry.  A bit of my dramatic side
leaked out there...)  The wx.ogl module has been deprecated in favor
of the new Python port of the OGL library located at wx.lib.ogl
contributed by Pierre Hjlm.  This will hopefully greatly extend the
life of OGL within wxPython by making it more easily maintainable and
less prone to getting rusty as there seems to be less and less
interest in maintaining the C++ version.  At this point there are just
a couple minor known compatibility differences, please see the
<a class="reference" href="MigrationGuide.html">MigrationGuide</a> file for details.</p>
<p>EVT_STC_POSCHANGED has been removed as it has been deprecated in
Scintilla for several releases now.</p>
<p>All the Window and GDI (pen, bitmap, etc.) class constructors and also
many toplevel functions and static methods will now check that a
wx.App object has already been created and will raise a
wx.PyNoAppError exception if not.</p>
<p>Added more default args as needed to allow most window types to be
constructed with only the parent window arg.  In some cases other args
may be required for normal operation, but they can usually be set
after construction.</p>
<p>Removed the deprecated ErrorDialogs and PythonBitmaps modules.  If you
were using these in your apps then please join wxPython-dev and assist
with a more modern reimplementation.</p>
<p>Added a new version (0.8.3) of FloatCanvas from Chris Barker.  It's now
in a subpackage of wx.lib.</p>
<p>It is now possible to change the tab traversal order of controls on a
panel or dialog.  For details see the new MoveAfterInTabOrder and
MoveBeforeInTabOrder methods of wx.Window.</p>
<p>Applied (and heavily modified) a patch from Eugene
&lt;<a class="reference" href="mailto:svip123&#64;fastmail.fm">svip123&#64;fastmail.fm</a>&gt; that allows the sample modules in the demo to be
edited and reloaded, all from within the demo.  You can switch back
and forth between the default and your edited version, and any errors
ocurring upon the reload are reported on the Demo tab.</p>
<p>Added a menu item in the demo that will open a PyShell window that has
the app and demo frame preloaded in the namespace.  This is another
good way to explore and play with the objects in the currently running
sample.  For example, load the Button sample and then do the following
in the PyShell:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = frame.demoPage.GetChildren()[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in range(0, 500, 10):
...     b.Move((x, 50))
...     app.Yield(True)
...     wx.MilliSleep(10)
</pre>
<p>wxGTK: Applied wxNO_BORDER patch (#1098374) for text control and combo

<ul class="simple">
<li>2-Apr-2004</li>
</ul>
<p>(See also the <a class="reference" href="MigrationGuide.html">MigrationGuide</a> file for details about some of the
big changes that have happened in this release and how you should
adapt your code.)</p>
<p>The wxWindows project and library is now known as wxWidgets.  Please
see <a class="reference" href="http://www.wxwindows.org/name.htm">http://www.wxwindows.org/name.htm</a> for more details.  This won't
really affect wxPython all that much, other than the fact that the
wxwindows.org domain name will be changing to wxwidgets.org, so mail
list, CVS, and etc. addresses will be changing.  We're going to try
and smooth the transition as much as possible, but I wanted you all to
be aware of this change if you run into any issues.</p>
<p>Many, many little fixes, changes and additions done as part of the move
to wxWidgets 2.5 that I have forgotten about.</p>
<p>Added wxMirrorDC.</p>
<p>Added wxIconLocation</p>
<p>Added Python wrappers and demos for the new wxVScrolledWindow,
wxVListBox, and wxHtmlListBox classes.</p>
<p>Added wrappers for wxBookCtrl and wxListbook.  wxNotebook now derives
from wxBookCtrl.</p>
<p>Added Gordon Williams' PyPlot module to the library, available as the
wx.lib.plot module.</p>
<p>I made a small but important change in the code that aquires the
Python Global Interpreter Lock to try and prevent deadlocks that can
happen when there are nested attempts to aquire the GIL.</p>
<p>The RPMs will now install menu items on Mandrake Linux in
Applications/Development/Tools for PyCrust, XRCed, etc.  The RPMs are
also installing icons and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*.desktop</span></tt> items in the generic KDE and
GNOME locations, but I don't know yet if they are resulting in menu
items on non-Mandrake systems.  (It didn't automatically do it on my
RH-9 build box but I didn't chase it very far...)  If you have ideas
for how to improve the .spec file to work better and/or on more
distros please send me a patch.</p>
<p>The RPMs are now built on a fairly generic RH-9 box, and I have tested
installing them also on my main Mandrake 9.2 box.</p>
<p>There are some big changes in the OS X disk image.  The actual
Installer package now <em>only</em> installs the wxMac dynlibs, wxPython
extension modules and Python packages, and also the command-line tool
scripts. The remaining items (demo, samples, and application bundles
for the Demo, PyCrust and XRCed) are now top-level items in the disk
image (.dmg file) that users can just drag and drop to wherever they
want to put them.</p>
<p>The wxWave class has been renamed to wxSound, and now has a slightly
different API.</p>
<p>Updated the AnalogClockWindow with many enhancements from E. A. Taco.</p>
<p>wxMac now has wx.ToggleButton!</p>
<p>wx.stc.StyledTextCtrl has been updated to version 1.58 of Scintilla.</p>
<p>To help with the wx.stc.StyledTextCtrl performance issues on wxMac
I've added a SetUseAntiAliasing method (and GetUseAntiAliasing too)
that will turn off the use of antialiased fonts in the wxSTC, allowing
it to bypass the slow text measuring routines and use the fast and
simple one instead.  By default the setting is turned off (on wxMac
only.)  When run on OSX the Py* apps have a new item on the Options
menu for controlling this setting if you would like to experiment with
it.</p>
<p>Updated wx.lib.calendar with many fixes and enhancements from Joerg
&quot;Adi&quot; Sieker.</p>
<p>Added wx.Display and wx.VideoMode.</p>
<p>AppleEvents can be handled by overriding wx.App methods MacOpenFile,
MacPrintFile, MacNewFile, and MacReopenApp.</p>
<p>Added wx.PlatformInfo which is a tuple containing strings that
describe the platform and build options of wxPython.  See the
MigrationGuide for more details.</p>
<p>Created a new extension module &quot;activex&quot; from Lindsay Mathieson's
newest <a class="reference" href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/~blackpaw1/wxactivex.html">wxActiveX</a> class.  (The existing iewin module used an older
version of this code, but only exposed the wxIEHtmlWin class.)  This
new module will (in theory ;-) ) allow you to host arbitrary ActiveX
controls in a wx.Window, <strong>without</strong> requiring the use of the win32com
and other PyWin32 modules!  This should eliminate the cronic problems
that have resulted from minor mismatches in how PyWin32 handles the
GIL and tstate when making callbacks, etc.  The older iewin module
will be left in this release as the new stuff is not fully backwards
compatible, but you should migrate your code to the new IEHtmlWindow
in wx.lib.iewin, so the old one can be eventually removed.
Additionally, I've always considered that the wx.lib.activexwrapper
module is an ugly hack that I only included in the lib because I
couldn't figure out anything better.  Well now we have something that,
if it isn't already, has the potential to be better.  So consider
migrating away from using activexwrapper as well.  Please see the
MigrationGuide for more details on using the new module.</p>
<p>Floats are allowed again as function parameters where ints are expected.</p>

<p>Use wxSTC in the demo for displaying the soucre code of the samples.</p>
<p>Lots of bug fixes and such from the wxWindows folks.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.newevent from Miki Tebeka.  Its usage is
demonstrated in the Threads sample in the demo.</p>
<p>Updates to wxMaskedEditCtrl.</p>
<p>Added wxMaskedNumCtrl.</p>
<p>Added Chris Barker's FloatCanvas.</p>

<h1><a id="id21" name="id21">2.4.1.2</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>19-Jun-2003</li>
</ul>
<p>Added wxScrolledPanel from Will Sadkin</p>
<p>Added SetShape method to top level windows (e.g. wxFrame.)</p>
<p>Changed wxSWIG to not generate Python code using apply, (since it will
be deprecated in the future) wxSWIG will use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">spam(*args,</span> <span class="pre">**kw)</span></tt> syntax
instead.  Also changed the generated __repr__ methods to be a bit more
informative.</p>
<p>Made the version number information more robust and uh, informative.
Also added asserts to check that the major.minor versions of wxPython
and wxWindows match.</p>
<p>Added the new wx &quot;renamer&quot; package that will dynamically import from
the wxPython package and rename wxFooBar --&gt; FooBar.  That means that
people can do imports without <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;import</span> <span class="pre">*&quot;</span></tt> and can use names like
wx.Frame instead of wx.wxFrame.  This is phase 1 of a full transition
to the new namespace.</p>
<p>Updated Scintilla to 1.52.  I also changed it to use wxListCtrl
instead of wxListBox for the AutoComplete window, added the ability to
use custom bitmaps in the margin and in the AutoComplete windows, and
worked out how to do proper clipping of child windows on wxGTK.</p>
<p>Patrick O'Brien's PyCrust package has been renamed to Py and now
includes several new tools.  As part of the change the location of the
pacakge has changed as well, it is now accessible as &quot;from wxPython
import py&quot; (or &quot;from wx import py&quot; using the new namespace.)  There
are still some transition modules in the wxPython.lib.PyCrust package
that will issue a warning and then import what is needed from the new
package.  These will be removed in a future release.</p>
<p>Added __nonzero__ method to wxTreeItemId, wxBitmap, wxImage, wxFont,
and most other classes that have an Ok or IsOK method.  This allows
code like &quot;if obj: ...&quot; to be the same as &quot;if obj.IsOk(): ...&quot;</p>
<p>Toolbars on wxMac can now have controls on them.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.analogclock module based on samples that were
passed back and forth on wxPython-users a while back.</p>
<p>Added masked edit controls (wxPython.lib.maskededit) by Jeff Childers
and Will Sadkin.  Updated wxTimeCtrl to use MaskedEdit.</p>
<p>When the __class__ of a dead object is replaced with _wxPyDeadObject
the __del__ of the original class is now called first.</p>
<p>Added wxTreeListCtrl.  (Looks like a wxTreeCtrl embedded in a
wxListCtrl, but actually is just giving multiple columns to a
wxTreeCtrl.)</p>
<p>Added wxFutureCall, a subclass of wxTimer that makes it easy to delay
a call to any Python callable object.</p>
<p>Added wxPy versions of wxPrintPreview, wxPreviewFrame, and
wxPreviewControlBar so they can be derived from in Python and be able
to override the C++ virtual methods.</p>
<p>Simplified how the wxSizer methods are wrapped, changed the name of
the &quot;option&quot; parameter to &quot;proportion&quot; to match the docs (&quot;option&quot; is
still accepted for compatibility, but this will go away in a future
release,) SetItemMinSize can now take a wxSize (or 2-tuple) parameter,
and Spacers can be specified with a wxSize (or 2-tuple) parameter</p>
<p>Added wxCursorFromBits.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>24-Mar-2003</li>
</ul>
<p>Gave up on generating a warning upon the use of the old true/false or
TRUE/FALSE values.</p>
<p>Fixed wxGenericTreeCtrl (used on wxGTK and wxMac for wxTreeCtrl) so
that it can successfully handle lots of nodes instead of overflowing
when the virtual height of the widget overflowed a 16-bit value.</p>
<p>Fixed the typemap that converts strings to wxColours to also accept
unicode.</p>
<p>Fixed problem where the wrong class name could sometimes be used for
OOR.</p>
<p>Fixed an interpreter lock problem in the __eq__ and __ne__ methods in
wxSize and etc.</p>
<p>Updated PyCrust to version 0.9</p>
<p>Instead of always logging C++ assertions, added wxPYAPP_ASSERT_LOG
flag to turn it on.  In most cases turning it into an exception (the
default behavior) is enough.  See below in the 2.3.4.1 notes for more
details.</p>

<p>Added missing wxRect methods</p>
<p>Add OOR support for wxApp objects too.</p>
<p>Added wxCursorFromImage, which works on wxMSW and wxGTK so far.</p>
<p>All platforms now send EVT_DESTROY_WINDOW.  Be warned that at the time
the event is sent the window is in the process of being deconstructed,
and so calling some (most?) methods of the window itself may cause
problems.</p>
<p>Fixed SF Bug #689481, a method in the OGL wrappers was using the wrong
return type.</p>
<p>Fixed SF Bug #689958, an endless loop in printout.py.</p>
<p>Added EVT_WINDOW_CREATE_ID and EVT_WINDOW_DESTROY_ID so these events
can be associated with a specific window ID and more easily caught by
the parent window.</p>
<p>Fixed copy-paste error in wxListCtrl.GetFirstSelected.</p>
<p>Added missing Init method (and an overloading wrapper) to wxLocale
wrapper.</p>
<p>Added a wxBitmap.SetMaskColour convenience method.</p>
<p>Changed how the dynamic event tables (used for all Python wx classes,
C++ wx classes typically use static event tables) are searched such
that they behave from a Python perspective more like the static tables
in C++.  Namely that if there are identical event bindings in a base
Python class and a derived Python class that the one in the derived
class will be found first and that if Skip is called that the one in
the base class will still be found instead of skipping directly to the
static stable in the C++ class.</p>
<p>Switched to using True/False in the wxPython lib and demo instead of
true/false or TRUE/FALSE to prepare for the new boolean type and
constants being added to Python.  Added code to wx.py to test for the
existence of the new constants and to create suitable values if not
present.</p>
<p>Added some static wxApp functions that help with integration with the
Mac UI.  They are no-ops on other platforms so it doesn't hurt to
always call them.  The functions are:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wxApp_GetMacDefaultEncodingIsPC
wxApp_GetMacSupportPCMenuShortcuts
wxApp_GetMacAboutMenuItemId
wxApp_GetMacPreferencesMenuItemId
wxApp_GetMacExitMenuItemId
wxApp_GetMacHelpMenuTitleName
wxApp_SetMacDefaultEncodingIsPC
wxApp_SetMacSupportPCMenuShortcuts
wxApp_SetMacAboutMenuItemId
wxApp_SetMacPreferencesMenuItemId
wxApp_SetMacExitMenuItemId
wxApp_SetMacHelpMenuTitleName
</pre>
<p>Refactored, enhanced and added capabilities for the DrawXXXList
functions, inspired by code from Chris Barker.</p>
<p>The wxWindows .mo language catalog files are now installed in a
subdirectory of the wxPython package dir on MSW since that platform
doesn't have a standard place for them.</p>
<p>Added missing deselect methods for wxGrid.</p>
<p>Fixed typemaps for wxGridCellCoordsArray.</p>

<p>Updated XRCed and wxTimeCtrl contribs.</p>
<p>Show a couple new wxGrid features in the demo.</p>
<p>Several bug fixes in wxWindows.</p>
<p>Added wxHtmlFilter.</p>
<p>wxASSERT and related C++ runtime diagnostics are now converted to
Python exceptions.  When an assert happens a wxPyAssertionError
(which derives from AssertionError) exception is created and when
control returns back to the Python code that invoked the C++ API it
will be raised.  The same exception restrictions are in place as
before, namely that exceptions can't cross from one Python layer
through C++ to another Python layer.  That simply means that if you
want to catch wxPyAssertionError or any other exception that you need
to do it before control returns to C++ at the end of your event
handler or callback code.  There is some test code in demo/wxButton.py
you can use to play with this new feature.</p>
<p>Added some methods to wxApp (SetAssertMode and GetAssertMode) that let
you control how C++ assertions are processed.  Valid modes are:
wxPYAPP_ASSERT_SUPPRESS, wxPYAPP_ASSERT_EXCEPTION, and
wxPYAPP_ASSERT_DIALOG.  Using _SUPPRESS will give you behavior like
the old &quot;final&quot; builds and the assert will be ignored, _EXCEPTION is
the new default described above, and _DIALOG is like the default in
2.3.3.1 and prior &quot;hybrid&quot; builds.  You can also combine _EXCEPTION
and _DIALOG if you wish, although I don't know why you would.</p>
<p>You can now overload OnInitGui, OnExit and OnAssert in your classes
derived from wxApp.</p>
<p>Added GetSelectedCells, GetSelectionBlockTopLeft,
GetSelectionBlockBottomRight, GetSelectedRows, GetSelectedCols nethods
to wxGrid.</p>
<p>Added Python == and != operators for some basic classes</p>
<p>Fixed the Python wrappers for wxInputStream so they no longer block
when reading from a wxProcess on wxGTK.  They now work more or less as
they did before 2.3.3.1 but the dual meaning of eof() has been
removed.  There is now a CanRead() method that lets you know if there
is data waiting to be read from the pipe.</p>
<p>Fixed method name clash in wxIEHtmlWin, renamed Refresh to RefreshPage.</p>
<p>Added Throbber from Cliff Wells to the library and the demo.</p>
<p>Windows installer prompts to uninstall old version first.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.evtmgr by Robb Shecter, which is an easier, more
&quot;Pythonic&quot; and more OO method of registering handlers for wxWindows
events using the Publish/Subscribe pattern.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.popupctl by Gerrit van Dyk which is a combobox-like
gizmo for poping up arbitrary controls.  It is currently using
wxDialog because of some issues with wxPopupWindow...</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.gridmovers by Gerrit van Dyk which facilitates the
dragging of columns and/or rows in a wxGrid.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.multisash by Gerrit van Dyk which is a nice
implementation of allowing the user to split a window any number of
times either horizontally or vertically, and to close the split off
windows when desired.</p>
<p>Added helpviewer tool that displays HTML books similarly to how MS
HTMLHelp viewer does.  Changed how the wxPythonDocs tarball is built
and added a script to launch the doc viewer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="id28" name="id28">2.3.3.1</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>19-Sep-2002</li>
</ul>
<p>Added wxSplashScreen.</p>
<p>Added wxGenericDirCtrl.</p>
<p>Added wxMultiChoiceDialog.</p>
<p>The calltip window and autocomplete window in wxSTC will now use a
wxPopupWindow if available on the platform (and functioning correctly)
so they can extend beyond the client area of the STC if needed.</p>
<p>Finished wrapping and providing typemaps for wxInputStream and also
added the stream ctor and other methods for wxImage so images can now
be loaded from any Python &quot;file-like&quot; object.</p>
<p>Changed the img2py tool to use PNG instead of XPM for embedding image
data in Python source code, and the generated code now uses streams to
convert the image data to wxImage, wxBitmap, or wxIcon.</p>
<p>Added the wxPython.lib.rcsizer module which contains RowColSizer.
This sizer is based on code from Niki Spahiev and lets you specify a
row and column for each item, as well as optional column or row
spanning.  Cells with no item assigned to it are just left blank.
Stretchable rows or columns are specified and work the same as in
wxFlexGridSizer.</p>
<p>Updated XRCed from Roman Rolinsky</p>
<p>Added wxBufferedDC.</p>
<p>Upgraded wxSTC from Scintilla 1.40 to Scintilla 1.45, and then again
to version 1.47, and one more time to 1.48! &lt;wink&gt;</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>UNICODE!</dt>
<dd><p class="first">wxWindows/wxPython can be compiled with unicode support enabled or
disabled.  Previous to wxPython 2.3.3 non-unicode mode was always
used.  Starting with 2.3.3 either mode is supported, but only if
it is also available in wxWindows on the platform.  Currently
wxWindows only supports unicode on MS Windows platforms, but with
the recent release of GTK+ 2.0 it is only a matter of time until
it can be done on wxGTK (Linux and other unixes) as well.</p>
<p>Unicode works best on platforms in the NT branch of the Windows
family tree (NT, win2k, XP) but it is now also possible to use the
same unicode binaries on win95/98/ME platforms as well!  This is
done by using a special library and DLL with the application
called MSLU, (Microsoft Layer for Unicode).  It simply gets out of
the way if the app is run on an NT box, otherwise if run on a
win9x box it loads a special DLL that provides the unicode
versions of the windows API.  So far I have not been able to get
this to work perfectly on win9x.  Most things work fine but
wxTaskBarIcon for example will cause a crash if used with the
unicode build on win95.</p>
<p class="last">So how do you use it?  It's very simple.  When unicode is enabled,
then all functions and methods in wxPython that return a wxString
from the C++ function will return a Python unicode object, and
parameters to C++ functions/methods that expect a wxString can
accept either a Python string or unicode object.  If a string
object is passed then it will be decoded into unicode using the
converter pointed to by wxConvCurrent, which will use the default
system encoding.  If you need to use a string in some other
encoding then you should convert it to unicode using the Python
codecs first and then pass the unicode string to the wxPython
method.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Added wxListCtrlAutoWidthMixin from Erik Westra.</p>
<p>Added wxIconBundle and wxTopLevelWindow.SetIcons.</p>
<p>Added wxLocale and wxEncodingConverter.</p>
<p>A little black magic...  When the C++ object (for a window or
whatever) is deleted there is no way to force the Python shadow object
to also be destroyed and clean up all references to it.  This leads to
crashes if the shadow object tries to call a method with the old C++
pointer.  The black magic I've done is to replace the __class__ in the
Python instance object with a class that raises an exception whenever
a method call (or other attribute access) is attempted.  This works
for any class that is OOR aware.</p>
<p>Added OOR support for wxGridCellRenderer, wxGridCellEditor,
wxGridCellAttr, wxGridCellAttrProvider, wxGridTableBase and their
derived classes.</p>
<p>Added wxImage.GetDataBuffer which returns an in-place edit buffer of
the image data.  (Patch #546009)</p>
<p>Added a sample that shows how to embed wxPython in a wxWindows C++
application.</p>
<p>Added wxPyWindow, wxPyPanel and wxPyControl which are just like their
wx counterparts except they allow some of the more common C++ virtual
methods to be overridden in Python derived classes.  The methods
supported are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DoMoveWindow
DoSetSize
DoSetClientSize
DoSetVirtualSize
DoGetSize
DoGetClientSize
DoGetPosition
DoGetVirtualSize
DoGetBestSize
InitDialog
TransferDataFromWindow
TransferDataToWindow
Validate
AcceptsFocus
AcceptsFocusFromKeyboard
GetMaxSize
AddChild
RemoveChild</p>
<p>If there are other methods that you think should be supported
please let me know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changed wxGenButton to derive from wxPyControl and overload
DoGetBestSize and AcceptsFocus.</p>
<p>Added wxArtProvider.</p>
<p>Added wxCallAfter which is a helper function that registers a function
(or any callable Python object) to be called once the next time there
are no pending events.  This is useful for when you need to do
something but it can't be done during the current event handler.  The
implementation is very simple, see wxPython/wx.py.</p>
<p>Fixed a boatload of reference leaks.</p>
<p>Added a demo of using a sizer in a wxScrolledWindow, in effect
creating a ScrolledPanel.</p>
<p>Added a sample to the demo that shows how to use radio menu items, and
other menu stuff.</p>
<p>Added wxIEHtmlWin.  This is essentially the same as using IE with the
ActiveXWrapper already in the library, but it is implemented all in
C++ and therefore does not need any of the modules from win32all and
so it is less fragile in the face of changes.</p>
<p>Fixed the ActiveXWrapper problem.  Looks like when the win32com
modules make a &quot;callback&quot; that they (incorrectly, IMHO) allocate a
transient thread state structure.  Since wxPython is now saving
tstates for it's own callbacks it ended up using garbage after
win32com got rid of the temporary tstate...</p>
<p>Added a generic static text control to wxPython.lib.stattext.  This is
so things like Boa and PythonCard can have a static text that can
respond to mouse events and etc.</p>
<p>Changed the wxDateTime.Parse* methods to return an int that will be -1
on failure, and the index where parsing stopped otherwise.</p>
<p>Moved tools to be a Python package in wxPython.tools, added scripts to
import and launch each tool.  This will let you import and use the
tools in your own scripts or apps as needed.  On Linux and OS X the
tool scripts are installed to {prefix}/bin so you should be able to
easily launch them from the command line.  For example, PyCrust can be
started with just the &quot;pycrust&quot; command.</p>
<p>Added a sample to the demo that catches various key events and
displays the details of the event.</p>
<p>Added wxWizard, wxWizardPage, wxWizardPageSimple and wxPyWizardPage.</p>
<p>Added wxXmlResourceHandler which allows you to create custom handlers
for nonstandard class types in XRC resources.  See the demo for an
example.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.mixins.rubberband module from Robb Shecter.</p>
<p>Added wxTimeCtrl from Will Sadkin.</p>

wxContextMenuEvent, wxContextHelp, wxContextHelpButton, wxTipWindow,
and a demo to show them in action.</p>
<p>Deprecated PyShell and PyShellWindow, added a snapshot of PyCrust (see
<a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycrust/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycrust/</a>. )</p>
<p>Added the new virtual list capabilities to wxListCtrl.</p>
<p>Added a wxSTC style editor from Riaan Booysen to the sample apps.</p>
<p>Added XRCed to the wxPython Tools directory, contributed by Roman
Rolinsky.</p>
<p>Added a new &quot;constructor&quot; to most of the window classes that calls the
default C++ constructor, (the one with no parameters) and also added the
corresponding  Create(...) method.  This allows you to do a 2-step
creation of windows which is sometimes required for doing things such
as setting extended style flags before the window is created, or for
passing the object to the XRC resource system to be created from the
resource.  The name of the new &quot;constructor&quot; is the original name of
the class with a &quot;Pre&quot; in it.  For example, wxPreWindow, wxPreFrame,
etc.</p>
<p>Updated to version 1.40 of Scintilla and updated wxStyledTextCtrl
accordingly.  While doing this update I dropped the wxLB_SORT style
from the wxListBox created for the AutoComplete functionality.  This
means that you will have to sort the keyword lists yourself, but you
are free to do case sensitive or case insensitive sorts and set the
wxSTC flag accordingly.</p>
<p>Updated wxColumnSorterMixin to also be able to place sort icons on the
column headers, and updated the wxListCtrl demo to show it off by
using wxColumnSorterMixin.</p>
<p>Added wxGenBitmapTextButton, TablePrint, etc. contribs from Lorne White.</p>
<p>Added wxNativeFontInfo and wxFontMapper.</p>
<p>Added pySketch to the samples.</p>
<p>Significantly changed how the Python interpreter lock and thread state
are managed, which should fix the problem of running on a
multi-processor machine.</p>
<p>Added wxPyLog so log targets can be created in Python to handle log
messages however is wished.  See demo/Main.py for an example.</p>
<p>Added wxFindReplaceDialog.</p>
<p>The second phase of OOR is implemented for wxEvtHandler, wxSizer,
wxShape and derived classes.  This means that functions and methods
that return an object derived from wxEvtHandler that was originally
created in Python, will return the original Python object (if it still
exists) instead of letting SWIG wrap a new shadow object around the
original C++ pointer.</p>
<p>Added some optimization methods to wxDC: GetBoundingBox, DrawLineList,
DrawPointList.</p>
<p>Added a set of sophisticated Error Dialogs from Chris Fama.</p>
<p>Added wxRightTextCtrl from Josu Oyanguren to wxPython.lib for aligning
text in a wxTextCtrl to the right side.</p>
<p>Added wxURLDataObject and an example showing drag and drop of URLs to
and from web browsers.  It's still not 100% bullet-proof for all types
of browsers, but it works for the majority of cases with the popular
browsers on Windows.  On wxGTK it seems that only Netscape 4.x works,
if anybody has any suggestions about this please bring it up on the
wx-dev list.</p>
<p>Added wxStopWatch.</p>
<p>Added wxMimeTypesManager and wxFileType.</p>
<p>Passing None for the handler parameter to one of the EVT_** functions
will now Disconnect the event.</p>
<p>Added wxPopupWindow and wxPopupTransientWindow.</p>
<p>Added wxFileHistory.</p>
<p>Added wxDynamicSashWindow, which allows you to endlessly split windows
by dragging a little tab next to the scrollbars.  Added a demo to show
this and also the ability of multiple wxStyledTextCtrls to share the
same document.</p>
<p>Added wxEditableListBox gizmo.</p>
<p>Updated wxEditor with lots of enhancements from Steve Howell and Adam
Feuer.</p>
<p>Added the &quot;SplitTree gizmos&quot; which are a collection of classes that
were designed to operate together and provide a tree control with
additional columns for each item.  The classes are
wxRemotelyScrolledTreeCtrl, wxTreeCompanionWindow,
wxThinSplitterWindow, and wxSplitterScrolledWindow, some of which may
also be useful by themselves.</p>
<p>Added wxDllWidget from Vaclav Slavik which allows wx widgets derived
from wxWindow to be loaded from a C++ .dll (or .so) and be used in a
wxPython program, without the widget having to be SWIGged first.  The
visible API of the widget is limited to wxWindow methods plus a
SendCommand method, but it is still quite powerful.  See
wxPython/contrib/dllwidget and wxPython/demo/dllwidget for more
details.</p>

<p>Removed initial startup dependency on the OpenGL DLLs so only the
glcanvasc.pyd depends on them, (on wxMSW.)</p>
<p>Changed wxFont, wxPen, wxBrush to not implicitly use the
wxThe[Font|Pen|Brush]List objects behind the scenes, but to use normal
ctor and dtors.</p>
<p>Exposed the wxThe[Font|Pen|Brush]List to wxPython.</p>
<p>Also added wxTheColourDatabase and added a library module (in the
wxPython.lib.colourdb module) to load LOTS more colour names into the
colour database.</p>
<p>Added wxWakeUpMainThread, wxMutexGuiEnter, wxMutexGuiLeave,
wxMutexGuiLocker and wxThread_IsMain to assist with dealing with GUI
access from non-GUI threads.</p>
<p>wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow is now (more) thread safe if non-GUI threads
use print, sys.stdout.write, etc.</p>
<p>Added CreateTextSizer and CreateButtonSizer to wxDialog</p>
<p>Added wxPython/lib/infoframe.py from Chris Fama.  It contains a class
that can be used in place of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow.</p>
<p>Added colourselect.py, imagebrowser.py and an updated calendar.py to
wxPython/lib from Lorne White.</p>
<p>Added patch to wxPoint_LIST_helper from Tim Hochberg that should make
it gobs faster in certain situations.</p>
<p>Added tools that will take an image file in a wx supported format and
convert it to data embedded in a Python source file.  The image is
converted to XPM format which is essentially a list of strings
containing info about each pixel.  The image's transparency mask is
included, if there is one, or a mask can be added if a mask colour is
specified on the command line.  It is then pickled and optionally
compressed and written to a Python source file along with functions to
convert it to either a wxBitmap or a wxImage.  See
wxPython/demo/images.py for examples, and wxPython/Tools/img2py.py for
the implementation.</p>
<p>Fixed wxStyledTextCtrl to be much faster on wxGTK.  There was some
experimental code that got left in place that ended up causing way too
many refreshes.</p>
<p>A couple more hacks in my_distutils.py so wxPython can be built with
the distutils that comes with Python 2.1.</p>
<p>Added a ton of missing methods for wxPrintData.</p>
<p>Switched to InnoSetup for MSW distributions.</p>
<p>Added wxToggleButton.</p>
<p>Fixed bug that prevented wxTreeCtrl.OnCompareItems from being called.</p>
<dl class="docutils">

GetCellHighlightROPenWidth
SetCellHighlightPenWidth
SetCellHighlightROPenWidth
GetGridWindow
GetGridRowLabelWindow
GetGridColLabelWindow
GetGridCornerLabelWindow</dd>
</dl>
<p>Added wxGetClientDisplayRect which on wxMSW returns a wxRect
representing the area on screen not occupied by the taskbar and such.
On other platforms it is equivallent to wxGetDisplaySize.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>OOR:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Implemented the first phase of OOR (Original Object Return).  See
the text in the demo for more details of what this means, but in a
nutshell methods such as wxWindow.GetParent or FindWindowById will
now return a shadow object of the proper type if it can.  By
&quot;proper type&quot; I mean that if the wxWindow pointer returned from
FindWindowById really points to a wxButton then the Python object
constructed will be of a wxButtonPtr class instead of wxWindowPtr
as before.  This should reduce or eliminiate the need for
wxPyTypeCast.  (Woo Hoo!)  The objects returned are still not the
original Python object, but that is the next step.  (Although it
will probably only work on Python 2.1 and beyond because it will
use weak references.)</p>
<p class="last">This first phase of the OOR plan is fairly significant and has
required a lot of changes all over wxPython, most of which should
be transparent to you, however I'm not 100% sure that it didn't
introduce any new bugs that are hiding somewhere and didn't get
stomped on during my testing.  So please be sure to test everything
thoroughly when you install this version and be sure to report any
object-type related oddities to me.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is now a wxObject class that most other classes derive from like
in C++, but the methods provided don't really match but are wxPython
specific.  It could have been added long ago but OOR required it so it
finally got done.</p>
<p>Finally added wxPyLineShape.GetLineControlPoints, which has been on my
list for a while.  The above OOR modification made this easier.</p>
<p>Fixed the __cmp__ methods for wxPoint and others.</p>
<p>Added wxWave.</p>
<p>Added the wxPython.lib.mixins package to the library, it is where
useful mix-in classes can be placed.  Currently there is one to help
make the columns in a wxListCtrl sortable, and the MagicIMageList from
Mike Fletcher.  If you have any custom code that can be factored out
of existing classes into a mix-in that would be useful to others
please send it to me for inclusion in this package.</p>
<p>Added a few little sample applications to help newbies to get started
by having smaller functional apps to play with.  They can be found in
wxPython/samples.</p>

<p>New typemaps for wxString when compiling for Python 2.0 and beyond
that allow Unicode objects to be passed as well as String objects.  If
a Unicode object is passed PyString_AsStringAndSize is used to convert
it to a wxString using the default encoding.</p>
<p>Fixed the generic buttons so tool tips work for them.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug in the demo's tree control.</p>
<p>Added a listbox to the listbox demo that shows how to find items with
a matching prefix as keys are typed.</p>
<p>Added code to the wxListCtrl demo to show how to get text from a
column in report mode.</p>
<p>Added code to the toolbar demo to clear the long help from the status
bar after 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Added wxJoystick.</p>
<p>Fixed wxTimer so it can be used as described in the docs, either with
a Notify method in a subclass, or sending an event to a wxEvtHandler
object, (usually a window.)</p>
<p>Added wxNotifyEvent.Allow()</p>
<p>Fixed GOBS of reference leaks.</p>
<p>Massive code changes and cleanup to allow wxPython to be split into
multiple extension modules again.  A Python CObject is used to allow
the &quot;export&quot; of SWIG functions and other common helper functions from
the wxc module to other modules, even if they are in separate shared
libraries.  Should also be usable from 3rd party code, just include
wxPython/src/export.h</p>
<p>Changed the default setup so the following are built as separate
extension modules:  calendar, glcanvas, grid, html, ogl, stc, and
utils.  Will probably add more later.</p>
<p>Changed the wxPrinterDC to use the new constructor taking a
wxPrintData object.  The old ctor is still there using the
wxPrinterDC2 name.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.anchors.py from Riaan Booysen.  It contains a class
that implements Delphi's Anchors with wxLayoutConstraints.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.fancytext from Timothy Hochberg.</p>
<p>Changed the GenericButtons to send their event in idle time, so the
mouse won't be captured when the event handler is called.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.rpcMixin from Greg Landrum, although it's not
integrated with the demo yet.  It allows a wxPython GUI to be an
XML-RPC server.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>26-Oct-2000</li>
</ul>
<p>Significantly changed how the wxStyledtextCtrl code that wraps
Scintilla is implemented.  Most of it is now automatically generated
from an interface definition file provided by Scintilla.  This means
that it will be much easier to stay in sync with new Scintilla
releases, but also means that some of the method and identifier names
have changed.  See wxPython/demo/data/stc.h for a copy of the C++
interface from which the Python interface is generated.  There is now
some inline documentation in that file that should really help explain
how things work.</p>
<p>I am now using the Python Distutils to build wxPython and to make some
of the distribution files.  (See <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/</a>)
This means no more messing with my kludgy build.py/Makefile hack,
builds will be more consistent with other Python extensions that also
use Distutils, and will hopefully make wxPython easier to build for
platforms where there have been troubles before.  If you are building
wxPython for Python 1.5.2 or for 1.6, then you will need to get and
install version 1.0 of Distutils from the website above.  If you are
using Python 2.0 then you already have it.</p>
<p>Added wxInputStream and the wxFileSystem family of classes,
contributed by Joerg Baumann.</p>
<p>Added wxProcess and support for it to wxExecute.  wxProcess lets you
get notified when an asyncronous child process terminates, and also to
get input/output streams for the child process's stdout, stderr and
stdin.</p>
<p>Removed the old python sizers.</p>
<p>Added __add__, __sub__ and __cmp__ (equality check only) for wxPoint
and wxRealPoint.</p>
<p>Changed the build to make one big extension module instead of one for
the core and each contrib.  This allowed me to do away with the
libwxPyHelpers.so on unix systems.</p>
<p>Lots of little fixes here and there.</p>
<p>Some hacks on wxGTK to try and make the AutoComplete listbox in the
wxStyledTextCtrl to behave better.  It's still not as nice as on
wxMSW, but at least it's a bit more usable now.</p>

<p>WARNING: A while back I asked what should be done about the Magic
Method Names.  (Methods that are automatically turned into event
handlers by virtue of their name.)  The consensus was that it is more
confusing to have them than to try and expand them to have greater
coverage.  I am finally getting around to removing the code that
generates the event binding.  This means that if you are using any of
the following method names without a EVT_* call that you need to
modify your code to add the EVT_* to hook the event to the method.</p>
<blockquote>
OnChar
OnSize
OnEraseBackground
OnSysColourChanged
OnInitDialog
OnPaint
OnIdle
OnActivate
OnMenuHighlight
OnCloseWindow
OnScroll</blockquote>

<p>Fixed thread state problem in wxTreeCtrl.GetBoundingBox and
GetSelections.</p>
<p>Fixed some problems in OGL.  Also wxShape.SetClientData and
.GetClientData can now deal with Python objects.</p>
<p>Added wxListCtrl.SortItems and changed the demo to show how to use it.</p>
<p>Plugged a memory leak.</p>
<p>Wrapped the new wxGrid and friends.  The old wxGrid class is no longer
available.  There are some incompatibilities, and unfortunately the
new classes are not documented yet, (however the methods are more
consistent with each other now so you may be able to guess pretty
good...)</p>
<p>Updated filebrowsebutton.py and calendar.py with changes from their
authors.  There is now a FileBrowseButtonWithHistory class (what a
mouthful!) and wxCalendar has printing support.</p>
<p>Added ActiveXWrapper to the library, and some good demos of it too.
It works great for embedding a COM (a.k.a OCX, a.k.a ActiveX) control
in a window and calling its methods.  It actually creates a new class
on the fly that derives from wxWindow, the COM CoClass and others
needed to make it all work.  The resulting class can be instantiated
just like wxWindow, used in sizers, etc.  It also responds to all COM
method calls, properties, etc., and if the class or a mix-in has
matching method names, then the COM events will be propogated back to
them.</p>
<p>Created a typemap that allows a string to be used for parameters
expecting a wxColour type.  The string is either a colour name as
defined in the wxColourDatabase, or a colour spec of the form
&quot;#RRGGBB&quot;.  See the wxStyledTextCtrl demo for an example.</p>
<p>I almost forgot to mention the wxStyledTextCtrl!  Yes, the
wxStyledTextCtrl is finally in wxPython!!  (And the crowd goes
wild...)   There's no documentaTion yet (the crowd boos and hisses...)
but I've included a very readable source file in the
wxPython/demo/data directory, a couple fairly good examples, and you
can also refer to the Scintilla documentaion at
<a class="reference" href="http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html">http://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaDoc.html</a> to help fill in the gaps
until the docs are done.  (The croud murmers contentedly as the tool
provider smiles convincingly and removes his flame-proof suit.)</p>

<p>Skipped a version number to match what has been released for wxGTK.</p>
<p>Updated wxMVCTree and added a demo for it, also fixed layout on GTK

<p>Added a wrapper class for the Visualization ToolKit (or VTK) in the
wxPython.lib.vtk module.  (<a class="reference" href="http://www.kitware.com/">http://www.kitware.com/</a>)</p>
<p>Fixed wxTreeCtrl.SetItemImage and GetItemImage to recognise the new
&quot;which&quot; parameter.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.spashscreen from Mike Fletcher.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.filebrowsebutton also from Mike Fletcher.</p>
<p>Renamed wxTreeCtrl.GetParent to GetItemParent to avoid a name clash
with wxWindow.GetParent.</p>
<p>Added wxIntersectRect to compute the intersection of two wxRect's.
It is used like this:</p>
<blockquote>
intersect = wxIntersectRect(rect1, rect2)</blockquote>
<p>If r1 and r2 don't intersect then None is returned, otherwise the
rectangle representing the intersection is returned.</p>
<p>Some bug fixes for Clipboard and Drag-n-Drop.</p>
<p>Rotated text!!!  WooHoo!  (See wxDC.DrawRotatedText())</p>
<p>Added a set of Generic Buttons to the library.  These are simple
window classes that look and act like native buttons, but you can have
a bit more control over them.  The bezel width can be set in addition
to colours, fonts, etc.  There is a ToggleButton as well as Bitmap
versions too.  They should also serve as a good example of how to
create your own classes derived from wxControl.</p>
<p>The C++ wxToolBar classes have been redone, and so have the wxPython
wrappers.  There have been slight modifications to some of the methods
but shouldn't impact anybody too much.  I took the opportunity to add
support for setting user data on each toolbar tool.  The new AddTool
methods look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>def AddTool(ID,</dt>
<dd>bitmap,
pushedBitmap = wxNullBitmap,
toggle = FALSE,
clientData = NULL,
shortHelpString = &quot;&quot;,
longHelpString = &quot;&quot;)</dd>
<dt>def AddSimpleTool(ID,</dt>
<dd>bitmap,
shortHelpString = &quot;&quot;,
longHelpString = &quot;&quot;,
toggle=FALSE)</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also corresponding InsertTool and InsertSimpleTool methods
that additionally take an integer position as the first parameter.</p>
<p>Added a wrapper for the new PCX and TIFF ImageHandlers.</p>
<p>wxRect now simulates attributes named left, right, top and bottom.</p>
<p>Removed all non wx stuff from the glcanvas module since DA's PyOpenGL
is better and compatible with the wxGLCanvas.  You can get it at
<a class="reference" href="http://starship.python.net:9673/crew/da/Code/PyOpenGL">http://starship.python.net:9673/crew/da/Code/PyOpenGL</a>.</p>
<p>Added some missing EVT functions.</p>
<p>Added Dirk Holtwic's editor classes to the wxPython.lib.editor
package.</p>
<p>Changed all the &quot;LIST&quot; parameter names to &quot;choices&quot; to match the docs.</p>
<p>More fixes for the wxFloatBar, and it now works on wxGTK even better
than wxMSW!  (The feat is accomplished by using the wxTB_DOCKABLE
style flag instead of trying to float it ourselves.)</p>

<p>Skipped a few version numbers so wxMSW, wxGTK and wxPython are all
syncronized.</p>
<p>wxImage.SetData now makes a copy of the image data before giving it to
wxImage.  I mistakenly thought that wxImage would copy the data
itself.</p>
<p>Fixed wxMSW's notebook so the pages get their size set as they are
being added.  This should remove the need for our
wxNotebook.ResizeChildren hack.</p>
<p>wxPanels now support AutoLayout, and wxNotebooks and wxSplitterWindows
no longer tell their children to Layout() themselves.  This will
probably only effect you if you have a wxWindow with AutoLayout inside
a notebook or splitter.  If so, either change it to a wxPanel or add
an EVT_SIZE handler that calls Layout().</p>
<p>Fixed deadlock problem that happened when using threads.</p>
<p>Added new HTML printing classes.</p>
<p>Added wxWindow.GetHandle</p>
<p>Apparently wxMouseEvent.Position has been deprecated in wxWindows as
it is no longer available by default.  You can use GetPositionTuple
(returning a tuple with x,y) instead, or GetPosition (returning a
wxPoint.)</p>
<p>Added wxPostEvent function that allows events to be posted and then
processed later.  This is a thread-safe way to interact with the GUI
thread from other threads.</p>
<p>Added Clipboard and Drag-and-Drop classes.</p>
<p>Added wxFontEnumerator.</p>
<p>Many updates to wxMenu, wxMenuBar.</p>
<p>wxPyEvent and wxPyCommandEvent derived classes now give you the actual
Python object in the event handler instead of a new shadow.</p>
<p>Added a Calendar widget from Lorne White to the library.</p>
<p>Made some fixes to the wxFloatbar.  It still has some troubles on
wxGTK...</p>

<p>This release is NOT syncronized with a snapshot release of wxGTK or
wxMSW.  For MSW this isn't much of a problem since you can get the
binaries from the web site.  For other platforms you'll have to build
wxGTK from CVS.  (See <a class="reference" href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/cvs.htm">http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/cvs.htm</a>)
To get the same set of sources from CVS that I used, checkout using

<p>Much more support for event-less callbacks and add-on modules.</p>

<p>Added wxWindow.GetChildren().  Be careful of this.  It returns a <em>copy</em>
of the list of the window's children.  While you are using the list if
anything changes in the real list (a child is deleted, etc.) then the
list you are holding will suddenly have window references to garbage
memory and your app will likely crash.  But if you are careful it works
great!</p>
<p>Added a bunch of new and missing methods to wxTreeCrtl.  The
SortChildren method is now supported, but currently only for the
default sort order.</p>
<p>Added typemaps for wxSize, wxPoint, wxRealPoint, and wxRect that allow
either the actual objects or Python sequence values to be used.  For
example, the following are equivallent:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
win = wxWindow(parent, size = wxSize(100, 100))
win = wxWindow(parent, size = (100, 100))
</pre>
<p>Super-charged the wxHtml module.  You can now create your own tag
handlers and also have access to the parser and cell classes.  There
is a tag handler in the library at wxPython.lib.wxpTag that
understands the WXP tag and is able to place wxPython windows on HTML
pages.  See the demo for an example.</p>
<p>A bunch of the methods of wxMenuBar were previously ifdef'd out for
wxGTK.  Added them back in since the methods exist now.</p>
<p>Wrapped the wxHtmlHelpController and related classes.</p>
<p>Wrapped the C++ versions of wxSizer and friends.  The Python-only
versions are still in the library, but deprecated.  (You will get a
warning message if you try to use them, but the warning can be
disabled.) The usage of the C++ versions is slightly different, and
the functionality of wxBorderSizer is now part of wxBoxSizer.  I have
added a few methods to wxSizer to try and make the transition as
smooth as possible, I combined all Add methods into a single method
that handles all cases, added an AddMany method, etc.  One step I did
not take was to make the default value of flag in the Add method be
wxGROW.  This would have made it more backward compatible, but less
portable to and from wxWin C++ code.  Please see the docs and demo for
further details.</p>
<p>Added wxPyEvent and wxPyCommandEvent classes, derived from wxEvent and
wxCommandEvent.  Each of them has SetPyData and GetPyData methods that
accept or return a single Python object.  You can use these classes
directly or derive from them to create your own types of event objects
that can pass through the wxWindows event system without loosing their
Python parts (as long as they are stored with SetPyData.)  Stay tuned
for more info and examples in future releases.</p>
<p>Added wxPython.lib.grids as an example of how to derive a new sizer
from the C++ sizers.  In this module you will find wxGridSizer and
wxFlexGridSizer.  wxGridSizer arrainges its items in a grid in which
all the widths and heights are the same.  wxFlexgridSizer allows
different widths and heights, and you can also specify rows and/or
columns that are growable.  See the demo for a couple examples for how
to use them.</p>
<p>Added the wxValidator class, and created a class named wxPyValidator
that should be used for the base class of any Python validators.  See
the demo for an example.  Please note that you MUST implement a Clone
method in your validator classes because of the way some things work
in the underlying C++ library.  I did not add wxTextValidator because
of some issues of how it transfers data to and from a wxString, which
in wxPython is automatically translated to and from Python strings, so
there would never be a concrete wxString that would hang around long
enough for the validator to do its job.  On the other hand, it should
be real easy to duplicate the functionality of wxTextValidator in a
pure Python class derived from wxPyValidator.</p>
<p>I've finally added a feature that has been on my list for close to two
years!  Ever wondered what that zero is for when you create your app
object?  Well now you can leave it out or explicitly set it to a true
value.  This value now controls what is to be done with sys.stdout and
sys.stderr.  A false value leaves them alone, and a true value sets
them to an instance of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow.  (On windows the
default is true, on unix platforms the default is false.)  This class
creates a frame containing a wxTextCtrl as soon as anything is written
to sys.stdout or sys.stderr.  If you close the window it will come
back again the next time something is written.  (You can call
app.RestoreStdio to turn this off.)  If you would rather that the stdio be
redirected to a file, you can provide a second parameter to your app
object's constructor that is a filename.  If you want to use your own
class instead of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow you can either implement
RedirectStdio() in you app class or change the value of
wxApp.outputWindowClass like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class MyApp(wxApp):
    outputWindowClass = MyClass

    def OnInit(self):
        frame = MyFrame()
        self.SetTopWindow(frame)
        return true
</pre>
<p>Please see the implementation of wxPyOnDemandOutputWindow and wxApp in
wx.py for more details.  A few words of caution:  if you are running
your app in a debugger, changing sys.stdout and sys.stderr is likely
to really screw things up.</p>
<p>Added wxCaret.  Unfortunately it's author has still not documented it
in the wxWindows docs...</p>
<p>Some new 3rd party contributions in wxPython.lib.  PyShell, in
shell.py is an interesting implementaion of an interactive Python
shell in wxWindows.  floatbar.py has a class derived from wxToolBar
that can sense mouse drags and then reparent itself into another
frame. Moving the new frame close to where it came from puts the tool
bar back into the original parent.  (Unfortunately there is currently
a bug in wxGTK's wxFrame.SetToolBar so the FloatBar has some
problems...)</p>

<p>This release is syncronized with release 2.1 snapshot 9 of wxWindows.</p>
<p>Switched to using SWIG from CVS (see <a class="reference" href="http://swig.cs.uchicago.edu/cvs.html">http://swig.cs.uchicago.edu/cvs.html</a>)
for some of the new features and such.  Also they have encorporated my
patches so there is really no reason to stick with the current (very
old) release...  This version of SWIG gives the following new
features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Keyword arguments.  You no longer have to specify all the
parameters with defaults to a method just to specify a
non-default value on the end.  You can now do this instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>win = wxWindow(parent, -1, style = mystyle)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There is now an an equivalence between Python's None and C++'s
NULL.  This means that any methods that might return NULL will
now return None and you can use none where wxWindows might be
expecting NULL.  This makes things much more snake-ish.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a new build system based on a new Python program instead of
raw makefiles.  Now wxPython builds are virtually the same on MSW or
Unix systems.  See the end of this file for new build instructions and
see distrib/build.py for more details.</p>
<p>wxDC.Bilt now includes the useMask parameter, and has been split into
two different versions.  wxDC.BlitXY is like what was there before and
takes raw coordinants and sizes, and the new wxDC.Blit is for the new
interface using wxPoints and a wxSize.</p>

<ul class="simple">

</ul>
<p>Added the missing wxWindow.GetUpdateRegion() method.</p>
<p>Made a new change in SWIG (update your patches everybody) that
provides a fix for global shadow objects that get an exception in
their __del__ when their extension module has already been deleted.
It was only a 1 line change in .../SWIG/Modules/pycpp.cxx at about
line 496 if you want to do it by hand.</p>
<p>It is now possible to run through MainLoop more than once in any one
process.  The cleanup that used to happen as MainLoop completed (and
prevented it from running again) has been delayed until the wxc module
is being unloaded by Python.</p>
<p>I fixed a bunch of stuff in the C++ version of wxGrid so it wouldn't
make wxPython look bad.</p>
<p>wxWindow.PopupMenu() now takes a wxPoint instead of  x,y.  Added
wxWindow.PopupMenuXY to be consistent with some other methods.</p>
<p>Added wxGrid.SetEditInPlace and wxGrid.GetEditInPlace.</p>
<p>You can now provide your own app.MainLoop method.  See
wxPython/demo/demoMainLoop.py for an example and some explaination.</p>
<p>Got the in-place-edit for the wxTreeCtrl fixed and added some demo
code to show how to use it.</p>
<p>Put the wxIcon constructor back in for GTK as it now has one that
matches MSW's.</p>
<p>Added wxGrid.GetCells</p>
<p>Added wxSystemSettings static methods as functions with names like
wxSystemSettings_GetSystemColour.</p>
<p>Removed wxPyMenu since using menu callbacks have been deprecated in
wxWindows.  Use wxMenu and events instead.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Added alternate wxBitmap constructor (for MSW only) as</dt>
<dd>wxBitmapFromData(data, type, width, height, depth = 1)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Added a helper function named wxPyTypeCast that can convert shadow
objects of one type into shadow objects of another type.  (Like doing
a down-cast.)  See the implementation in wx.py for some docs.</p>
<p>Fixed wxImage GetData and SetData to properly use String objects for
data transfer.</p>
<p>Added access methods to wxGridEvent.</p>
<p>New Makefile/Setup files supporting multiple dynamic extension modules
for unix systems.</p>
<p>Fixes for the wxGLCanvas demo to work around a strange bug in gtk.</p>
<p>SWIG support routines now compiled separately instead of being bundled
in wx.cpp.</p>

<p>Fixed wxComboBox.SetSelection so that it actually sets the selected
item.  (Actually just removed it from wxPython and let it default to
wxChoice.SetSelection which was already doing the right thing.)</p>
<p>Added the Printing Framework.</p>
<p>Switched back to using the wxWindows DLL for the pre-built Win32
version.  The problem was needing to reinitialize static class info
data after loading each extension module.</p>
<p>Lots of little tweaks and additions to reflect changes to various
wxWindows classes.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug with attaching objects to tree items.  Actually was a
symptom of a larger problem with not obtaining the interpreter lock
when doing any Py_DECREFs.</p>
<p>wxSizer and friends.  Sizers are layout tools that manage a colection
of windows and sizers.  Different types of sizers apply different
types of layout algorithms.  You saw it here first!  These classes are
not even in the wxWindows C++ library yet!</p>

<p>Well obviously the numbering scheme has changed.  I did this to
reflect the fact that this truly is the second major revision of
wxPython, (well the third actually if you count the one I did for
wxWindows 1.68 and then threw away...) and also that it is associated
with the 2.0 version of wxWindows.</p>
<p>I have finally started documenting wxPython.  There are several pages
in the wxWindows documentation tree specifically about wxPython, and I
have added notes within the class references about where and how wxPython
diverges from wxWindows.</p>
<p>Added wxWindow_FromHWND(hWnd) for wxMSW to construct a wxWindow from a
window handle.  If you can get the window handle into the python code,
it should just work...  More news on this later.</p>
<p>Added wxImageList, wxToolTip.</p>

<p>wxPython on wxGTK works!!!  Both dynamic and static on Linux and
static on Solaris have been tested.  Many thanks go to Harm van der
Heijden for his astute detective work on tracking down a nasty DECREF
bug.  Okay so I have to confess that it was just a DSM (Dumb Stupid
Mistake) on my part but it was nasty none the less because the
behavior was so different on different platforms.</p>
<p>The dynamicly loaded module on Solaris is still segfaulting, so it
must have been a different issue all along...</p>

<p>1. Worked on wxGTK compatibility.  It is partially working.  On a
Solaris/Sparc box wxPython is working but only when it is statically
linked with the Python interpreter.  When built as a dyamically loaded
extension module, things start acting weirdly and it soon seg-faults.
And on Linux both the statically linked and the dynamically linked
version segfault shortly after starting up.</p>
