Added Locate tool.

0.1.4-1

Edit->Locate command (Ctrl-L) for quick selection of items.

not with labels/sizers.

Some improvements: relative paths for files supplied as command-
line argument work correctly, notebook panels are highlighted

-------

Bugs with currentEncoding and frame testing fixed.

Some required parameters are set to default if missing.

Unsupported classes are tolerated, with warning message.

wxScrolledWindow added (to 'control' pulldown menu, not yet to the

Multi-line editing for labels and some values (wxTextCtrl,
wxHtmlWindow).

0.1.1-1

wxHtmlWindow, wxCalendarCtrl and wxGenericDirCtrl - they are too
rarely used).

Changed some sizes in panel to better work with different fonts.

Fixed double-refreshing after Ctrl+R.

Maybe something else that I've forgot. It's been a looong day... :)

0.0.8-1
-------

Using WX_2_4_BRANCH.

control), improved wxXRC format suppor (menu styles, etc.).

Some I18N support: parsing "encoding" attribute in XML header, later
it can be modified in "properties" panel for "XML tree".

UNIX note: currently XML writing for non-ascii chars works only if
sys.getdefaultencoding() returns good value. To do this, one has to
put following lines to "sitecustomize.py" file:

# Start code segment
import sys
sys.setdefaultencoding('iso-8859-1')	# or whatever
# End code segment

0.0.7
-----

Some command-line arguments.
