0.9.5 (12/23/2005)
-------------------

Applied a series of enhancments by Franz Steinaeusler, Adi Sieker, and
Sebastian Haase, up until their 7-31-2005 version.  (Their next
version broke some existing functionality, and added some confusing
hacks, and I didn't feel that the incremental gains were worth the
loss at that point so I stopped at 7-31-2005.)

Their changes include the following:

* The Autocomplete and Calltip windows can now be opened manually with
  Ctrl-Space and Ctrl-Shift-Space.

* In the stand alone PyCrust app the various option settings, window
  size and position, and etc. are saved and restored at the next run.

* Added a help dialog bound to the F1 key that shows the key bindings.

* Added a new text completion function that suggests words from the
  history.  Bound to Shift-Return.

* F11 will toggle the maximized state of the frame.

* switched to Bind() from wx.EVT_*().

* Display of line numbers can be toggled.

* F12 toggles a "free edit" mode of the shell buffer.  This mode is
  useful, for example, if you would like to remove some output or
  errors or etc. from the buffer before doing a copy/paste.  The free
  edit mode is designated by the use of a red, non-flashing caret.

* Ctrl-Shift-F will fold/unfold (hide/show) the selected lines.



On top of these changes I (Robin Dunn) added the following:

* General code cleanup and fixes.

* Use wx.StandardPaths to determine the location of the config files.

* Remove Orbtech attributions from the UI, they've been there long
  enough.

* Use wx.SP_LIVE_UPDATE on crust and filling windows.

* Extended the saving of the config info and other new features to the
  PyShell app too.  Additionally, other apps that embed a PyCrust or a
  PyShell can pass their own wx.Config object and have the Py code
  save/restore its settings to/from there.

* All of the classes with config info get an opportunity to save/load
  their own settings instead of putting all the save/load code in one
  place that then has to reach all over the place to do anything.

* Enable editing of the startup python code, which will either be the
  file pointed to by PYTHONSTARTUP or a file in the config dir if
  PYTHONSTARTUP is not set in the environment.

* Added an option to skip the running of the startup code when 
  PyShell or PyCrust starts.

* PyCrust adds a pp(item) function to the shell's namespace that
  pretty prints the item in the Display tab of the notebook.  Added
  code to raise that tab when pp() is called.

* Added an option for whether to insert text for function parameters
  when popping up the call tip.

* Added Find and Find-Next functions that use the wx.FindReplaceDialog.






0.9.4 (1/25/2004 to //2004)
------------------------------

Removed wxd decorators in favor of new SWIG-generated docstrings.

Removed docs tabs from crust interface:
* wxPython Docs
* wxSTC Docs

Fixed Calltip tab refresh problem on Windows.

shell.autoCompleteAutoHide added with default of False.

Changed default namespace of Shell to __main__.__dict__, instead of an
empty dictionary.


0.9.3 (9/25/2003 to 1/24/2004)
------------------------------

Fun and games with dynamic renaming.  Details of any other changes
were lost in the confusion.  I'll try to do better in the future.


0.9.2 (5/3/2003 to 9/25/2003)
-----------------------------

Changed to the new prefix-less "wx" package::

    import wx

instead of::

    from wxPython import wx

Fixed typo in ``PyWrap.py``::

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main(sys.argv)

should have been::

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

Added pretty-print Display tab to Crust, based on suggestion from
Jason Whitlark.

Improved ``Can*`` checks in ``EditWindow``, since STC is too lenient,
particularly when it is set to read-only but returns True for
CanPaste() (seems like an STC bug to me)::

    def CanCopy(self):
        """Return True if text is selected and can be copied."""
        return self.GetSelectionStart() != self.GetSelectionEnd()

    def CanCut(self):
        """Return True if text is selected and can be cut."""
        return self.CanCopy() and self.CanEdit()

    def CanEdit(self):
        """Return True if editing should succeed."""
        return not self.GetReadOnly()

    def CanPaste(self):
        """Return True if pasting should succeed."""
        return stc.StyledTextCtrl.CanPaste(self) and self.CanEdit()


0.9.1 (3/21/2003 to 5/2/2003)
-----------------------------

PyCrust is dead!  Long live Py!

* Renamed ``PyCrust`` package to ``py``.
* Moved code to wxPython's CVS repository.

Fixed bug in ``introspect.py`` on introspecting objects occurring
immediately after a secondary prompt, like this::

    >>> l = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> for n in range(3):
    ...     l.  <-- failed to popup autocomplete list

Added documentation files:

* PyManual.txt
* wxPythonManual.txt
* wxPythonPackage.txt
* wxPythonExamples.txt

Added PyAlaMode and PyAlaCarte code editors.

Major refactoring to support ``editor`` and ``shell`` from the same
base.

Renamed program files:

* ``PyCrustApp.py`` to ``PyCrust.py``
* ``PyFillingApp.py`` to ``PyFilling.py``
* ``PyShellApp.py`` to ``PyShell.py``
* ``wrap.py`` to ``PyWrap.py``

Removed disabling of autocomplete for lists of 2000 items or more.
The current implementation of wxSTC can now handle lists this big.

Improved handling of ``sys.path`` to mimic the standard Python shell.


0.9 (2/27/2003 to 3/20/2003)
----------------------------

Added fontIncrease, fontDecrease, fontDefault signals, receivers and
keybindings::

    Ctrl+]            Increase font size.
    Ctrl+[            Decrease font size.
    Ctrl+=            Default font size.

Continued enhancement of the decorator capability to provide better
documentation and docstrings for wxPython classes and functions.

Introduced new tabbed interface:

* Namespace
* Calltip
* Session
* Dispatcher
* wxPython Docs
* wxSTC Docs

``Filling.tree`` now expands tuples as well as lists.  (It should have
done this all along, I just never noticed this omission before.)

Added this True/False test to all modules::

    try:
        True
    except NameError:
        True = 1==1
        False = 1==0

Added ``wxd`` directory with decoration classes.


0.8.2 (1/5/2003 to 2/26/2003)
-----------------------------

Wrapped ``sys.ps1``, ``sys.ps2``, and ``sys.ps3`` in ``str()``.
(Thanks, Kieran Holland.)

Fixed minor things found by PyChecker.

Changed locals to use ``__main__.__dict__`` and added code to clean up
the namespace, making it as close to the regular Python environment as
possible.  This solves the problem of pickling and unpickling
instances of classes defined in the shell.

Made ``shell.PasteAndRun()`` a little more forgiving when it finds a
ps2 prompt line with no trailing space, such when you copy code from a
web page.

Improved autocomplete behavior by adding these to shell::

    self.AutoCompSetAutoHide(False)
    self.AutoCompStops(' .,;:([)]}\'"\\<>%^&+-=*/|`')

Added ``decor`` directory, ``decorator.py``, ``stcDecor.py``, and
``stcConstants.py``.  These all serve the purpose of adding docstrings
to existing wxPython classes, in particular the ``wxStyledTextCtrl``.

Added ``wrap.py``, a command line utility for running a wxPython app
with additional runtime-tools loaded, such as PyCrust (the only tool
at this point).

Flushed the clipboard Cut/Copy operations so that selections will
exist in the clipboard even after PyCrust has been closed.

Improved the suppression of docstrings for simple data types appearing
in the namespace viewer.

Better handling of autocompletion with numeric types; no
autocompletion when typing a dot after an integer.  If the
autocompletion is desired, type a space before the dot::

    func = 3 .

More Filling!!! The namespace tree is now dynamically updated.


0.8.1 (12/20/2002 to 12/25/2002)
--------------------------------

Improved keyboard handling with Autocomplete active.  You can now use
Enter as well as Tab to select an item from the list.

Disabled autocomplete for lists of 2000 items or more.  The current
implementation of wxSTC can't handle lists this big.

Changed ``filling`` to always display docstrings for objects.  This is
useful for objects whose docstrings have been decorated, rather than
coming directly from the source code.  (Hmmm.  Sounds like someone is
doing some decorating.  I wonder where that would be helpful? <wink>)

Fixed handling of icon.  Added ``images.py`` file.


0.8 (10/29/2002 to 12/16/2002)
------------------------------

Added "help" to startup banner info.

Made all ``wx`` and ``stc`` imports explicit.  No more ``import *``.

Replaced use of the ``wx`` module's ``true`` and ``false`` with
Python's ``True`` and ``False``.

Changed ``introspect.getRoot()`` to use ``tokenize`` module.  This
does a slightly better job than the previous parsing routine and the
code is clearer.

Improved handling of whitespace and empty types during introspection.

Fixed cut/copy clipboard problem under Linux.  (Robin Dunn rocks!!!)

Added shell.about() which works like this::

    >>> shell.about()
    PyCrust Version: 0.8
    Shell Revision: 1.80
    Interpreter Revision: 1.15
    Python Version: 2.2.2
    wxPython Version: 2.3.3.1
    Platform: linux2

Added copy plus and paste plus to shell menu.

Moved shell menu from ``shell.py`` to ``shellmenu.py``.

Added ``sys.stdin.readlines()`` support.

Added ``time.sleep()`` in ``readline()`` and ``OnIdle()`` event
handler to free up the CPU.


0.7.2 (2/22/2002 to 8/27/2002)
------------------------------

Tweaked ``getAttributeNames()`` to pick up a few more attributes::

    '__bases__', '__class__', '__dict__', '__name__', 'func_closure',
    'func_code', 'func_defaults', 'func_dict', 'func_doc',
    'func_globals', 'func_name'

Added a tests directory and unit tests.

Improved support for empty types in the shell: ``[]``, ``()`` and
``{}`` as far as when call tips and autocompletion are available.

Added support for the other triple string - ``''''''``.

Refactored ``introspect.py`` to improve testability.

Improved call tips for unbound methods by leaving the "self"
parameter, since unbound methods require an instance be passed.

Fixed call tip bug where a tip was displayed when a "(" was typed
after an object that wasn't callable.

Fixed ``getAllAttributeNames`` when ``str(object)`` fails.

Added brace highlighting.  (Thank you, Kevin Altis.)

Fixed problem displaying unicode objects in ``PyFilling``.

Changed how ``filling.py`` checks for expandable objects.  Lists are
now expandable objects.

Made the key handling more robust when there is an active text
selection that includes text prior to the last primary prompt.  Thanks
to Raul Cota for pointing this out.

Fixed wxSTC problem with brace highlighting and non-us keyboards.
(Thank you for the patch, Jean-Michel Fauth.)

Added ``busy = wxBusyCursor()`` to key points in ``shell`` and
``filling``.

Added ``OnCloseWindow`` handler to ``ShellFrame`` and ``CrustFrame``.

Default to ``SetWrapMode(1)`` for shell and namespace viewer.

Added ``shell.wrap()`` and ``shell.zoom()``.

Added autoCompleteKeys hooks for Raul Cota.

Cleaned up various little key handling bugs.

Changed input methods to get values from shell, rather than dialog
boxes.  Renamed ``readIn`` to ``readline`` and ``readRaw`` to
``raw_input``.


0.7.1 (12/12/2001 to 2/21/2002)
-------------------------------

Fixed ``OnChar()`` issues effecting European keyboards, as reported by
Jean-Michel Fauth.

Fixed ``introspect.py`` issue with xmlrpc objects reported by Kevin
Altis.

Fixed some introspect/PyFilling issues with regard to Python 2.2.

Fixed font background color as reported by Keith J. Farmer.  (Thanks)

Fixed problem with call tips and autocompletion inside multiline
commands as report by Kevin Altis.

Improved ``OnKeyDown`` handling of cut/copy/paste operations based on
feedback from Syver Enstad.  (Thanks)

Added a ``shell.help()`` method to display some help info.

Changed sort of items in the namespace viewer to case insensitive.

Changed ``attributes.sort(lambda x, y: cmp(x.upper(), y.upper()))`` in
advance of an upcoming fix to an autocompletion matching bug in wxSTC.

Improved support for ZODB by allowing namespace drilldown into BTrees.

Added ``shell.PasteAndRun()`` to support pasting multiple commands into
the shell from the clipboard.  Ctrl+Shift+V or v.

Enter now always processes a command (or copies down a previous one.)
To insert a line break, press Ctrl+Enter.

Escape key clears the current, unexecuted command.

History retrieval changed to replace current command.  Added new keys
to insert from history - Shift+Up and Shift+Down.

Better call tips on objects with ``__call__`` methods.

Improved call tip positioning calculation.


0.7 (10/15/2001 to 12/11/2001)
------------------------------

Changed how command history retrieval functions work.  Added Alt-P,
Alt-N as keybindings for Retrieve-Previous, Retrieve-Next.

Added full support for multi-line commands, similar to IDLE.

Changed ``introspect.getAttributeNames()`` to do a case insensitive
sort.

Changed Cut/Copy/Paste to deal with prompts intelligently.  Cut and
Copy remove all prompts.  Paste can handle prompted or not-prompted
text.

Added ``CopyWithPrompts()`` method attached to Ctrl-Shift-C for those
times when you really do want all the prompts left intact.

Improved handling of the shell's read-only zone.

Changed ``CrustFrame.__init__`` parameter spec to include all
parameters allowed by a ``wxFrame``.

Changed ``FillingText`` to be read-only.

Renamed ``PyCrust.py`` to ``PyCrustApp.py`` to eliminate
package/module name conflicts that kept you from doing ``from PyCrust
import shell`` inside files located in the ``PyCrust`` directory.

Renamed ``PyFilling.py`` to ``PyFillingApp.py`` and ``PyShell.py`` to
``PyShellApp.py`` to maintain consistency.

Removed the ``__date__`` property from all modules.

Fixed bug in ``introspect.getCallTip()``, reported by Kevin Altis.


0.6.1 (9/19/2001 to 10/12/2001)
-------------------------------

Changed ``Shell.run()`` to always position to the end of existing
text, as suggested by Raul Cota.

Changed ``introspect.getAllAttributeNames()`` to break circular
references in ``object.__class__``, which occurs in Zope/ZODB
extension classes.

Changed ``filling.FillingTree.getChildren()`` to introspect extension
classes.

Fixed minor bugs in ``introspect.getCallTip()`` that were interfering
with call tips for Zope/ZODB extension class methods.

In preparation for wxPython 2.3.2, added code to fix a font sizing
problem.  Versions of wxPython prior to 2.3.2 had a sizing bug on Win
platform where the font was 2 points larger than what was specified.

Added a hack to ``introspect.getAllAttributeNames()`` to "wake up"
ZODB objects that are asleep - in a "ghost" state.  Otherwise it
returns incomplete info.


0.6 (8/21/2001 to 9/12/2001)
----------------------------

Added ``PyFilling.py`` and ``filling.py``.

``PyShell.py`` and ``PyFilling.py`` can now be run standalone, as well
as ``PyCrust.py``.

Added ``crust.py`` and moved some code from ``PyCrust.py`` to it.

Added command history retrieval features submitted by Richie Hindle.

Changed ``shell.write()`` to replace line endings with OS-specific
endings.  Changed ``shell.py`` and ``interpreter.py`` to use
``os.linesep`` in strings having hardcoded line endings.

Added ``shell.redirectStdin()``, ``shell.redirectStdout()`` and
``shell.redirectStderr()`` to allow the surrounding app to toggle
requests that the specified ``sys.std*`` be redirected to the shell.
These can also be run from within the shell itself, of course.

The shell now adds the current working directory "." to the search
path::

    sys.path.insert(0, os.curdir)

Added support for distutils installations.


0.5.4 (8/17/2001 to 8/20/2001)
------------------------------

Changed default font size under Linux to::

    'size'   : 12,
    'lnsize' : 10,

Changed ``Shell`` to expect a parameter referencing an Interpreter
class, rather than an intepreter instance, to facilitate subclassing
of Interpreter, which effectively broke when the Editor class was
eliminated.

Fixed ``PyCrustAlaCarte.py``, which had been broken by previous
changes.

Created ``InterpreterAlaCarte`` class as an example for use in the
demo.

Split ``PyCrust.py`` into ``PyCrust.py`` and ``PyShell.py`` in
anticipation of ``PyFilling.py``.


0.5.3 (8/16/2001)
-----------------

Added patch to ``PyCrust.py`` to fix wxPython bug::

    wxID_SELECTALL = NewId() # This *should* be defined by wxPython.


0.5.2 (8/14/2001 to 8/15/2001)
------------------------------

Shortened module names by dropping "PyCrust" as a prefix.

Changed ``version`` to ``VERSION`` in ``version`` module.

Added Options menu to PyCrust application.

Eliminated the Editor class (and editor module) by merging with Shell.
This means that Shell "is a" wxStyledTextCtrl rather than "has a".
There just wasn't enough non-gui code to justify the separation.
Plus, Shell will be much easier for gui toolkits/designers to deal
with now.


0.5.1 (8/10/2001 to 8/14/2001)
------------------------------

Added ``introspect`` module.

Moved some functionality from ``PyCrustInterp`` to ``introspect``.

Changed ``introspect.getRoot()`` to no longer remove whitespace from
the command.  This was a remnant of a previous approach that, when
left as part of the current approach, turned out to be a really bad
thing.

Changed ``introspect.getRoot()`` to allow commands of ``''``, ``""``,
``""""""``, ``[]``, ``()``, and ``{}`` to pass through.  This allows
you to type them, followed by a dot, and get autocomplete options on
them.

Changed ``introspect.getRoot()`` to identify some situations where
strings shouldn't be considered roots.  For example::

    >>> import PyCrust  # To illustrate the potential problem.
    >>> len('PyCrust.py')

Typing the dot at the end of "PyCrust" in the second line above should
NOT result in an autocompletion list because "PyCrust" is part of a
string in this context, not a reference to the PyCrust module object.
Similar reasoning applies to call tips.  For example::

    >>> len('dir(')

Typing the left paren at the end of "dir" should NOT result in a call
tip.

Both features now behave properly in the examples given.  However,
there is still the case where whitespace precedes the potential root
and that is NOT handled properly.  For example::

    >>> len('this is a dir(')

and::

    >>> len('This is PyCrust.py')

More code needs to be written to handle more complex situations.

Added ``locals=None`` parameter to ``Shell.__init__()``.

Added support for magic attribute retrieval.  Users can change this
with::

    >>> shell.editor.autoCompleteIncludeMagic = 0

Added the ability to set filters on auto completion to exclude
attributes prefixed with a single or double underscore.  Users can
exclude one or the other or both with::

    >>> shell.editor.autoCompleteExcludeSingle = 1
    >>> shell.editor.autoCompleteExcludeDouble = 1


0.5 (8/8/2001)
--------------

Mostly just a final version change before creating a release.


0.4 (8/4/2001 to 8/7/2001)
--------------------------

Changed version/revision handling.

Fixed bugs.


0.3 (8/2/2001 to 8/3/2001)
--------------------------

Removed lots of cruft.

Added lots of docstrings.

Imported to CVS repository at SourceForge.

Added call tips.


0.2 (7/30/2001 to 8/2/2001)
---------------------------

Renamed several files.

Added command autocompletion.

Added menus to PyCrust.py: File, Edit and Help.

Added sample applications: ``PyCrustAlaCarte.py``,
``PyCrustAlaMode.py``, and ``PyCrustMinimus.py``.


0.1 (7/1/2001 to 7/19/2001)
---------------------------

Added basic syntax coloring much like Boa.

Added read-only logging much like IDLE.

Can retrieve a previous command by putting the cursor back on that
line and hitting enter.

Stdin and raw_input operate properly so you can now do ``help()`` and
``license()`` without hanging.

Redefined "quit", "exit", and "close" to display a better-than-nothing
response.

Home key honors the prompt.

Created SourceForge account, but nothing was posted.


In the beginning, there was pie... (7/1/2001)
---------------------------------------------

Blame it all on IDLE, Boa and PythonWin.  I was using all three, got
frustrated with their dissimilarities, and began to let everyone know
how I felt.  At the same time, Scintilla looked like an interesting
tool to build a shell around.  And while I didn't receive much in the
way of positive feedback, let alone encouragement, I just couldn't let
go of the idea of a Scintilla-based Python shell.  Then the PythonCard
project got to the point where they were talking about including a
shell in their development environment.  That was all the incentive I
needed.  PyCrust had to happen...
