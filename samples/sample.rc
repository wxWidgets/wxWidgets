// this minimal resource file is all what is needed for most of the wxWidgets
// samples

// note that the icon used by the Explorer (i.e. the programs icon) is the
// first icon in the executable and the icons are sorted both by their order
// and alphabetically (!), so put this icon first and give it a name
// starting with "a"
aaaaaaaa ICON "sample.ico"

// this icon is used with wxFrame::SetIcon()
sample ICON "sample.ico"

// Note that wxUSE_RC_MANIFEST needs to be defined to 1 to embed the wx-defined
// manifest, this is not done by default to avoid conflicts with the manifest
// embedded by MSVS projects.
//
// An application manifest is needed for the application UI to look properly
// and for DPI awareness, so make sure that you define wxUSE_RC_MANIFEST=1 to
// include it from here or add the manifest at the build system level.
//
// See "Using a Manifest" section of docs/msw/install.md for more information.

// Set this to 1 if you don't want to use manifest resource provided by
// wxWidgets but wxUSE_RC_MANIFEST is somehow defined elsewhere.
#define wxUSE_NO_MANIFEST 0

// When embedding manifest here, predefine this symbol to enable full High DPI
// support, see MSW subsection of "Platform-Specific Build Issues" section in
// the "High DPI Support" guide in wxWidgets manual for more details.
//
// As mentioned above, this has no effect unless wxUSE_RC_MANIFEST=1.
#ifndef wxUSE_DPI_AWARE_MANIFEST
#define wxUSE_DPI_AWARE_MANIFEST 2
#endif

// this file contains the standard icons, cursors etc. and also includes the application
// manifest mentioned above
#include "wx/msw/wx.rc"
