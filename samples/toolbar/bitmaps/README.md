PNG icons in this directory were generated from Tango Desktop Project[1] SVG
sources and are in public domain.

[1]: http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project

The `foo.png` and `foo_2x.png` files were generated by running

    $ inkscape -e foo.png -w 32 -h 32 foo.svg
    $ inkscape -e foo_2x.png -w 64 -h 64 foo.svg

and then `foo_png.c` files were generated by running

    $ ../../../misc/scripts/png2c.py foo.png > foo_png.c

for each icon.
