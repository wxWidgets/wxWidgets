BUGS
=====================================================================

- dmalloc shows duplicate deletion after merging two lines and
  deleting the second half

- word wrap for objects with lots of non-space needs to search in positive
  direction if begin of first object is reached

  - delete in empty line doesn't always work
  - fix initial scrollbar sizes
  - fix horiz scrollbar size
  - occasionally wraps lines wongly (twice) ??


TODO
=====================================================================

- Image at end of a message doesn't get considered properly in
  wxLayoutList::GetSize(), so it cannot be seen
- searching for text
- moving cursor in non-edit mode
- cursor screen positioning ignores font sizes once again :-(
   --> UpdateCursorScreenPos() cannot work as it ignores previous font formatting commands.
       Either draw cursor when drawing text, or wait for new wxLayoutObjectCmd to be fully
       implemented.

RECENTLY FIXED (?)
  - fix(simplify) cursor size calculation
  - delete in empty line doesn't work
  - fix horiz scrollbar size OK here, a Mahogany problem?
  - with a large number of lines, wraps to top of scrolled window
    --> check where the problem lies, add a debug function showing all coordinates
  
- update rectangle (needs support in wxllist and wxWindows)
  --> needs a bit of fixing still
      some code bits are commented out in wxlwindow.cpp
      offset handling seems a bit dodgy, white shadow to top/left of cursor


  - replacement of llist in window
  - undo
  - font optimisations(!)
  - occasionally wraps lines wongly (twice) ??
  - UNDO
  later:
    - DragNDrop ... broken in wxGTK at present
    - cut&paste ... broken in wxGTK at present, Paste already implemented
    - Selections

- More optimisations:
  - let each line have a pointer to the last layoutcommand and let that
    one only store the settings that changed, then we no longer need to
    recalculate all the lines
