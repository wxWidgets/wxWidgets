BUGS
=====================================================================

- dmalloc shows duplicate deletion after merging two lines and
  deleting the second half

- word wrap for objects with lots of non-space needs to search in positive
  direction if begin of first object is reached

  - delete in empty line doesn't always work
  - fix initial scrollbar sizes
  - fix horiz scrollbar size


TODO
=====================================================================

Adding many lines makes it terribly slow.

Printing produces empty pages only.

Selections:
  - moving in negative direction doesn't work
  - selection state not properly reset, only works once
  - selecting non-text objects is strange

- Changing default settings in Clear() or changing/inserting/deleting
  a wxLayoutObject needs to update the m_StyleInfo in all lines, only
  then can we start using that one.
  
- update rectangle (needs support in wxllist and wxWindows)
  --> needs a bit of fixing still
      some code bits are commented out in wxlwindow.cpp
      offset handling seems a bit dodgy, white shadow to top/left of cursor

  - replacement of llist in window
  - UNDO
  - DragNDrop

  - Update docs, do full rtf/html editing. 
  - Verify html export.
