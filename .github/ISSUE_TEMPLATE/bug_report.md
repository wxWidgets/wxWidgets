IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

Please note that this entry field uses Markdown, see

https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

if you're unfamiliar with it, and make sure to use the "Preview" tab just above
to review your issue before submitting it to verify that your formatting is
correct.

In particular, please use code blocks, i.e. put ``` on a separate line before
and after any block of code or long text (such as compiler or make output).

Also make sure to escape, using backslash, i.e. `\<`, any angle brackets
to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML tags.

Finally, feel free to remove the explanatory comments, including this one,
after reading (and hopefully following) them.

### Description
<!--
Please use the following sections in your report:

#### Bug description:

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

#### Expected vs observed behaviour:

Please describe what you expected to happen and what actually happens. Make
sure to explain what exactly is the problem, just attaching a screenshot is
not always sufficient. When in doubt, please provide more details rather
than too few.

#### Stack trace:

If relevant, i.e. if the problem is a crash or an assert failure, please run
the program under debugger and copy and paste here (as text, not as an image:
you can use Ctrl+C in MSVS "Stack" window) the stack shown when you break into
the debugger once the problem happens.

#### Patch or snippet allowing to reproduce the problem:

Please attach the smallest possible patch allowing to reproduce the problem
in a sample. If there is absolutely no appropriate sample, please attach a
minimal self-contained example in a single file.

Skip this step if the problem can be reproduced in one of the samples
without any changes.

#### To Reproduce:

Steps to reproduce the behaviour, please make them as detailed as possible.
For example:

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '...'
3. Scroll down to '...'
4. See error
