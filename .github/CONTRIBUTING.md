# How to Contribute to wxWidgets

We appreciate receiving contributions and have a detailed
[contributor guide](https://www.wxwidgets.org/develop/how-to-contribute/)
which explains everything you ever wanted to know for contributing to
wxWidgets.

For the impatient, the short version is that you may [report issues][1] or,
even better, open [pull requests][2] in [wxWidgets repository][3] on GitHub
with your changes. But please consider reading the guide above if you hadn't
done this before.

### Thanks in advance and looking forward to your contributions!
