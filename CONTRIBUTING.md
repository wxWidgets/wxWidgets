# How to Contribute to wxWidgets

We appreciate receiving contributions and we have a community-maintained
[guide for contributors](http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Development:_How_To_Contribute)
which explains everything you ever wanted to know for contributing to
wxWidgets.

But if you'd like a shorter version, here it is: we'd prefer to receive your
[patches](http://trac.wxwidgets.org/wiki/HowToSubmitPatches) as
[new tickets](http://trac.wxwidgets.org/newticket) in our Trac installation.
In particular, please notice that we currently don't use Github pull requests,
so please don't open them unless you have been explicitly asked to do it by a
wxWidgets developer.

### Thanks in advance and looking forward to your contributions!
